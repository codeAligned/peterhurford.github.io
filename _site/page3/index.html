    <p>Some people have committed a great deal of their lives to trying to best make the world a better place. I’m trying to sit down with some of these people and learn more about their thoughts and motivations.</p>

<p>Today, I sit down with Ryan Carey, who has spent a lot of time working on various projects to make the world a better place, from setting up the utilitarian forum, <a href="http://www.felicifia.org/">Felicifia</a>, to co-creating an “effective altruist” meetup group in Melbourne, Australia.  He is now currently collaborating with <a href="http://www.leverageresearch.org/">Leverage Research</a> and the <a href="http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Centre for Effective Altruism</a> on research into the far future and associated risks.  Ryan has recently been blogging about his thoughts and experiences on <a href="http://careyryan.com/">his personal blog</a>.

    <p>I think it’s important to keep things fresh.  It seems like at least once a year or so, I change what the site looks like.  This year, server problems, financial costs, and other bloat inspired me to move away from <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> and paid hosting on <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> to the wonderful land of a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll static blog</a> hosted by <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>.  Back five years ago when I first signed on with Dreamhost, none of these tools existed.  Now, it’s time that I finally adopt them.</p>

<p>I’ll still have to get used to writing in Markdown.  But hopefully you find this site faster and easier to use than before.  It sure looks better on mobile phones.  Let me know if you have any comments.</p>

    <p>So I still do these…  Yeah.</p>

<p><a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/14/the-virtue-of-silence/">“The Virtue of Silence”</a>: “Leah Libresco writes a couple of essays on an ethical dilemma reported in the New York Times. In the course of a confidential medical history, a doctor hears her patient is suffering from stress-related complaints after having sent an innocent man to prison. The doctor wants to know whether it is ethical to report the matter to the police. The Times’ columnist says yes – it would save the poor prisoner. Leah says no – violating medical confidentiality creates an expectation that medical confidentiality will be violated in the future, thus dooming patients who are too afraid to talk about drug use or gay sex or other potentially embarrassing but important medical risk factors.  But both sides are ignoring the much bigger dilemma lurking one meta-level up: is it ethical to debate this dilemma in the New York Times?”</p>

<p><a href="http://utilitarian-essays.com/robustness-against-uncertainty.html">Charity Cost-Effectiveness in an Uncertain World</a>: “Evaluating the effectiveness of our actions, or even just whether they’re positive or negative by our values, is very difficult. One approach is to focus on clear, quantifiable metrics and assume that the larger, indirect considerations just kind of work out. Another way to deal with uncertainty is to focus on actions that seem likely to have generally positive effects across many scenarios, and often this approach amounts to meta-level activities like encouraging positive-sum institutions, philosophical inquiry, and effective altruism in general. When we consider flow-through effects of our actions, the seemingly vast gaps in cost-effectiveness among charities are humbled to more modest differences, and we begin to find more worth in the diversity of activities that different people are pursuing. Those who have abnormal values may be more wary of a general “promote wisdom” approach to shaping the future, but it seems plausible that all value systems will ultimately benefit in expectation from a more cooperative and reflective future populace.”

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In the past, some people have suggested that we “gamify” effective altruism some more, and create points for doing altruistic-y things, like donating our money or volunteering our time.  I think this could be a good idea, but rather than seeing individual scores, I’d much rather see a collective team score for EA.  We’d compete as a group to beat our past group selves (make March better than February, for example) rather than compete amongst ourselves as individuals.</p>

<p>There are several problems with the individual competition model, but the biggest problem is the most fundamental – <strong>effective altruism is not</strong> (and shouldn’t be) <strong>a competition.</strong>  Rather, we are a team.  A community.  We all have one common goal.</p>

<p>I know some effective altruists who see EAs like Holden Karnofsky or what not do incredible things, and feel a little bit of resentment at themselves and others; feeling inadequate that they can’t make such a large difference.  This is an important feeling for generating a desire to improve, and keeping a <a href="http://michaelgr.com/2007/04/15/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset-which-one-are-you/">growth mindset</a> in the face of this could lead to great things for you.  However, it’s even more important not to let this get you into depression, <strong>simply because Holden’s success is also your success.</strong></p>

<p>All effective altruists care about is making sure that the world is a better place.  It doesn’t matter who is doing the better-ing.  If Holden, Bill Gates, and Dustin Moskovitz each have 1 billion EA points and you only have five, you should be celebrating the fact that the EA community is collectively at 3 billion and five EA points and that you’re helping.  You shouldn’t feel bad that you’re not doing as well.</p>

<p>We all have different skills and abilities.  Growth mindset does say that we each have an ability to be incredibly effective and altruistic, but we still all start with different places.  It’s simply not the case that all of us, right this year, could be making seven figure donations to GiveWell or be putting in 80 hours a week at a top non-profit.  But we all can do our best and try a little harder.</p>

<p>Let’s start seeing ourselves more as a community where everyone has something to offer and celebrate our collective success, not despair over who is or is not the most effective.  Effective altruism shouldn’t be a competition (at least, among individuals).</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p><em>Jacy is an effective altruist trying to decide what career to go into after college.  He’s currently choosing between a Ph.D. in neuroscience or a Ph.D. in economics.  He wrote to me asking for advice.  This was my reply.  We both agreed it would be good to publish it so that others thinking about Ph.D. programs can benefit as well.</em></p>

<p>-</p>

<p>I made you wait a long time for not too much, because I don’t know a lot about PhD programs.  So I’ll be saying more general things that are less helpful.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I’m skeptical of PhD programs because they tend to really restrict your options (committing you to a path for several years), which seems bad early on when you’re just learning about what you can do.</p>

<p>My intuition is that a PhD is a pretty poor path toward earning a lot of money, because the earnings are not a guarantee and they are in the more distant future, requiring discounting for both time and probability.  An economics PhD might be an exception for opening up superior finance careers, but I suspect that if you have the talent to do well in finance, you’d have that talent immediately and could go in straight away.  That’s just a guess though.

    <p><em>Over at Felicifia, Alonzo Fyfe, blogger at <a href="http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/">Atheist Ethicist</a> and <a href="http://secularite.com/real-world-ethics-alonzo-fyfe/">The Secularite</a>, and I <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1024">had a debate</a> on “Which is a better theory of utilitarianism – Alonzo Fyfe’s desirism or Peter Hurford’s two-level utilitarianism?”.  I wanted to reprint that debate here.  Here’s the first entry (of eight).  This entry was written by Alonzo Fyfe.</em></p>

<p>-</p>

<p>I want to defend the claim that desirism (desire utilitarianism) is the best form of utilitarianism - better even than Peter Hurford’s version of RM Hare’s two-level theory. </p>

<p>I wish to start by explaining its differences from other utilitarian theories and suggesting how these make desirism stronger than those other theories.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>What is it like to be extremely poor?</p>

<p>We know that the extremely poor are living on less than what $1.25 a day could buy in the United States.  But this seems implausible.  Wouldn’t someone with that little money just end up dying of starvation very quickly?  Simulations like <a href="https://www.livebelowtheline.com/">Living Below the Line</a> can only go so far.  It’s difficult to understand what it’s like to be that poor.</p>

<p>However, it’s now becoming a bit easier to understand.  Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo, authors of the popular book <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938">Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty</a></strong> and co-founders of <a href="http://www.povertyactionlab.org/">The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab</a>, have written a paper called <a href="http://economics.mit.edu/files/530">“The Economic Lives of the Poor”</a>.  Using survey data from thirteen different countries, Banerjee and Duflo are able to tell the tale of life as a poor person.</p>

<p>Here’s an informative summary of their research.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There is a lot of effort in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">effective altruist movement</a> right now.  Community building would include anything broadly related to recruitment and retention for the EA movement, aiming to get existing EAs to become more EA (and less likely to quit EA) as well as getting new people to become EA.  This seems <em>prima facie</em> to be very high impact for many classical reasons like the <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration">haste consideration</a> that recruiting one person now seems to double your impact.</p>

<p>However, not too much EA effort seems channeled into community building at the moment.  <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://www.80000hours.org/">80K Hours</a>, <a href="http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>, and <a href="http://www.intelligence.org">the Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> are all primarially research organizations.  Organizations like 80K Hours and ACE once were outreach / community building organizations, but then intentionally rebranded and refocused specifically on research, eschewing community building.  GiveWell has considered many times to improve effort put into marketing, and chosen not to.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Periodically, in times of blog inactivity, I like to come back and report all the things I’ve been doing while not blogging.  Here’s a complete run down of the more recent:</p>

<p><strong>I finished up Recruitment for my fraternity.</strong>  It was basically working a part-time 20hrs/wk job for two weeks doing lots of event planning, but we ended up getting twelve fine men to join our fraternity.  Well worth it!</p>

<p><strong>I’ve been working with Ozzie Gooen on <a href="http://www.dotimpact.im">.impact</a></strong>, a distributed volunteer force working to produce really useful projects.  Here’s <a href="https://impact.hackpad.com/Projects-aRiPtncmuKS">a list of projects our group is working on</a> and you can check <a href="http://dotimpact.im/meetings.html">our meetings log</a> for their status.  Besides helping coordinate the group as a whole, I’m also working on building a <a href="http://www.jobboard.im">Job Board</a> (<a href="https://impact.hackpad.com/Job-Board-G2ZocnkVTsc">more details here</a>) and <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/peterhurford.com/document/d/1nA3VYi3-UbAOefSWCNcFQQ2fTIceiX1CkyZMIHO-q2Q/edit">studying vegetarian advocacy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I’ve been working on learning more computer programming.</strong>  In addition to working on the Job Board, I’ve begun to work for a friend’s startup called <a href="http://www.jorgestradingpost.com">Jorge’s Trading Post</a>, doing some PHP development for them.  I’ve also been learning more Ruby on Rails, Python, and JavaScript.  It helps that I’m now in a Computer Science class and have to program for actual homework.
