    <p>Recently, my university <a href="https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/9579">had a TEDx event</a>, and I was one of the people that got to give a talk:</p>

<iframe width="500" height="281" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UKX_xzUGEcI" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>My goal of the talk was to present the idea that effectiveness in charity choice matters, with particular care to highlight the research of <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a> and the work of <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto">The Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a>.</p>

<p>Here are my notes on how the talk went:

    <p><em>Recently, an effective altruist contacted me looking for career advice.  This EA had previously been working on a philosophy Ph.D., but recently decided to abandon the field due to insufficient stable job opportunities.  As abandoning the philosophy field is looked upon as very negative by those still in the field, this EA asked me to keep their identity anonymous.  Therefore, this person goes by the alias “Phyllis Schmidt”.</em></p>

<p>Phyllis is currently looking at a wide-variety of options for what to do next, looking to make an informed “best guess”, work on that career for a bit, and then re-evaluate.</p>

<p>Phyllis is currently considering (roughly ranked):</p>

    <p>What started out as some links and commentary on a discussion of Pigovian taxation <a href="http://peterhurford.tumblr.com/post/83316812303/pigovian-taxation-and-confiscatory-taxation-boring">ended up becoming an entire post on my Tumblr instead</a>.</p>

<p>And then I did it again.  <a href="http://peterhurford.tumblr.com/post/83319461315/how-much-does-money-matter-in-politics">Now I analyze how much money matters in politics</a>.  Answer: it’s complicated?</p>

<p>One interesting way to think of ethics is as <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/uz/protected_from_myself/">protecting you from yourself</a>: “But why not become an expert liar, if that’s what maximizes expected utility?  Why take the constrained path of truth, when things so much more important are at stake?  Because, when I look over my history, I find that my ethics have, above all, protected me from myself.  They weren’t inconveniences.  They were safety rails on cliffs I didn’t see.  I made fundamental mistakes, and my ethics didn’t halt that, but they played a critical role in my recovery.”</p>

<p>Speaking of very lengthy discussions, here’s <a href="http://raikoth.net/libertarian.html">one on libertarianism</a>, and why it’s sorta wrong sorta misguided sorta maybe?  On the other end of things (by the same author), we get a <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/">left-libertarian manifesto</a>.  Left-libertarianism sounds pretty good to me, quite in line with my discussion of Pigovian taxation earlier.</p>

<p>An interesting study looks at <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2421943">how donors respond to evidence of effectiveness in advertisements of charities</a>.  The paper hypothesizes that those who are altruistically-inclined respond positively to evidence, whereas those who are donating to seek a “warm glow” of personal happiness respond negatively to evidence.</p>

<p>A new Pew survey finds that Americans <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/4/18/5626068/pew-survey-americans-terrified-new-technology">don’t feel ready for a future of driverless cars, lab grown meat, and servant robots</a>.  However, as <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2010/12/27/from-yuck-to-yippee">“From Yuck to Yippee”</a> in Reason Magazine points out, people tend to be opposed to new potential technology right until they become actual, like in vitro fertilization.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I <a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/sunday-links-4-earning-to-give/">wrote a summary of “earning to give”</a>, or the idea of looking specifically for a high paying job in order to earn a lot of money, and then use your large disposable income to donate to charity.  Now, Pablo Stafforini has <a href="http://www.stafforini.com/blog/writings-on-earning-to-give-an-annotated-bibliography/">expanded that work into a larger annotated bibliography</a>.</p>

<p>You may have heard that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/lies-damned-lies-and-medical-science/308269/">90% of all medical research is flawed</a>.  Turns out that <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/17/90-of-all-claims-about-the-problems-with-medical-studies-are-wrong/">this claim is flawed</a>.</p>

<p>So you wanna learn how to code?  Whatever your motivation, computer programming and general computer know-how are good skills to have.  Programming knowledge can be potentially high value for careers or start-up opportunities, and with not too much time investment, you can figure out if programming is something you would enjoy and be good at.

    <p>I was recently <a href="http://careyryan.com/peter-hurford/">interviewed by Ryan Carey</a> about the effective altruist movement, movement building, .impact, and work on the far-future.  Yay!</p>

<p>Exercising regularly is really important for living longer, staying smarter and healthier, being less depressed, being more attractive, being more respected, and being higher energy.  But what should we do?  Recently, I’ve been enjoying the guides put together by <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16gJJeE1HdUl2BHCL19qAs-P4GrcnFTmibNdW5X3COLU/edit">Rob Wiblin</a> and <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/juc/optimal_exercise/">Romeo Stevens</a>.  Personally, I like to run twice a week and do <a href="http://stronglifts.com/">the Stronglifts weightlifting program</a> three times a week.

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I’ve recently been looking at some potential careers that may be of interests to effective altruists.  While I’m certainly pretty happy to look into web development, I think another strong career option that is not very frequently mentioned is working in a foundation.  I’d love to look into this more deeply, but I thought it would be good to first offer some preliminary thoughts on the subject.</p>

<p>So far, I’ve only spent four hours on this, including the time it took to write this post.  As such, it’s very likely I’ve missed important considerations.  If there is enough interest, I – or someone else – could look into this more deeply.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Foundation work seems potentially high impact for EAs because salaries are high and matching programs are generous.  For exmaple, a senior program officer for the Gates Foundation can potentially donate $209K a year while still keeping $30K/year for themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foundation work also offers major influencing opportunities that many other EA careers lack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, jobs at foundations appear very competitive and hard to get.  A survey of the top ten foundations by asset size shows that program associates require around 5+ years of prior relevant experience, and program officers require around 8+ years of prior relevant experience plus a Masters degree or Ph.D.  Though there may be other routes in, such as non-program positions (e.g., accountant) or internships.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall, working for a foundation is potentially a high-impact career, though not as high impact as I may have first guessed.  Because of the high amount of prep work needed, it seems like a foundation job would not be as potentially high impact as working in computer programming or finance – which offer similarly high salaries with less prep time – or law – which requires similar prep time, but offers higher salaries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems like foundation work would be a good option for people who already have the relevant qualifications (Masters degree, multiple years of experience) to try for, or for someone to try and get in via an alternate route, like an internship.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>.impact is a group of people who want to volunteer on really useful projects. This means, however, we need some idea of whether or not our projects are actually useful. Thus, the purpose of this essay is to analyze whether or not our projects have been useful, whether putting more time and money into .impact is worth the cost, where .impact has stumbled, and what our plans for the future are.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>.impact has worked on a total of 25 projects, 8 of which have been launched (Skillshare, Improving EA Presence on Wikipedia, EA Interview Series, Utilitarian Essays Redesign, CEA Homepage Redesign, Giving What We Can Redesign, and the EA Reddit).</p>

    <p>Right now, we think the core benefits of .impact can be categorized as working on (a) building the EA community, (b) building EA infrastructure, (c) learning about volunteering, (d) giving people skills and credibility, and (e) encouraging an ethos of trying things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our case is not very rigorous.  A lot of our evidence is anecdotal, and most of our impact  lies in our yet-to-be-realized potential as an organization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>.impact has encountered setbacks.  We’ve found the supply of volunteering to be more limited than expected.   We’ve also found volunteer software projects to be more difficult than originally assumed, with it taking much more time than expected to make much progress on projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’ve also found it difficult to predict how useful our projects would be.  So far .impact has not progressed as much as we would like in systematic needs analysis, metric measurement, or project prioritization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The original goal of some of our members to learn programming through doing programming projects has been more difficult to realize.  Aligning high-impact development with education has proven challenging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our costs to date have been ~$50 and ~860 person hours (valued at $34.4K).  However, much of .impact work is in the free time, and opportunity costs seem to be lower than one would initially expect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall, we’re quite confidant that we justify our costs and we look forward to seeing what happens in the next few months.</p>
  </li>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p><em>Over at Felicifia, Alonzo Fyfe, blogger at <a href="http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/">Atheist Ethicist</a> and <a href="http://secularite.com/real-world-ethics-alonzo-fyfe/">The Secularite</a>, and I <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1024">had a debate</a> on “Which is a better theory of utilitarianism – Alonzo Fyfe’s desirism or Peter Hurford’s two-level utilitarianism?”.  I wanted to reprint that debate here.  Here’s the second entry (of eight).  This entry was written by me.  This is a continuiation of the <a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/fyfe-hurford-debate-alonzo-round-one">previous entry written by Alonzo</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I want to first spend some of my precious word count mentioning how much of an honor it is to be engaging with Alonzo Fyfe on this important issue.  In many ways I owe Alonzo a lot for where I am today.  In 2011, I was a huge fan of desirism.  I learned many aspects of moral philosophy from reading Fyfe and became interested in ethics due to following Alonzo’s journey to figure out the right thing.  Perhaps ironically the first place I learned about the “two level utilitarianism” was from Fyfe himself. </p>

<p>In this debate, I offer “two-level utilitarianism” as a better view of utilitarianism.  However, I agree with Alonzo that this is more of a friendly discussion than a debate.  I must admit it might be hard for Alonzo to give up desirism after spending so much of his life defending it, just as it would be hard for me to give up utilitarianism after having a blog called <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com">“The Everyday Utilitarian”</a>.  But I rest assured that we are both beholden to the truth more than our particular brands of utilitarianism and believe we can be trusted to update our beliefs in the face of new arguments.

    <p><em>Follow up to <a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/six-month-review-ii-june-november-2013/">“Six Month Review II: June-November 2013”</a>.</em></p>

<p>Previously, I’ve publicly published <a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/a-year-of-mostly-new-years-resolutions/">monthly reviews</a> where I’ve reviewed progress on habits and published <a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/six-month-review-ii-june-november-2013/">six-month reviews</a> where I’ve gone in-depth on personal life strategy.  While I still aim to review myself <a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-i-am-productive/">on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis</a>, I am no longer going to publish these.  Instead, I’ve recently found that the monthly review is too quick to have meaningful things to say, while the six-month review is too slow.  Therefore, I’ve consolidated into a three-month review.  Here’s my personal review for the months of December, January, and February.  I’ve been delayed in getting this out due to the <a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/behold-the-new-site">site redesign</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-my-path-to-impact">What Is My Path to Impact?</h2>

<p>I find it useful to start this review by stating my plans, and then seeing how well I did against these plans.  Broadly, I still self-identify as an <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hx4/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/">effective altruist</a>, which means I want to do my best to make the world a better place.  But easier said than done!  How do I aim to do that?</p>

<h4 id="my-plan-broadly">My Plan, Broadly</h4>

<p>In <a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-im-giving-and-why/">“Where I’m Giving and Why”</a>, I write that there is “a huge priority to learn more about opportunities for doing good” and therefore “I’ve decided to spend my money and time trying to figure out how to learn more in reliable ways” (see also <a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">me on unproven causes</a>, my <a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-ive-changed-my-mind-on-my-approach-to-speculative-causes/">follow-up to that post</a>, and <a href="http://www.effective-altruism.com/paul-christiano-on-cause-prioritization-2/">Paul Christiano on cause prioritization</a>).
