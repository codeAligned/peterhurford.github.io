    <p>So, the blog went dead again, which means it’s time to revive the blog with a run-down of all the non-blog things I’ve been doing recently.</p>

<p><strong>I finished my seventh semester of college,</strong> which means I only have one more semester to go.  I’m now on Winter Break, which means I get a free month to do whatever I want.  This (probably) means more blogging!</p>

<p><strong>I’ve done a lot <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-have-i-been-doing-ii/">more of the same</a></strong> – more career work (I have exciting news on this front forthcoming!), more EA projects work (we’re called <a href="http://www.dotimpact.im">.impact</a> now), more volunteering (though I’ve now stopped working with Giving What We Can in order to focus more on other projects), and more learning programming (this week is the last week of the R course!).</p>

<p>Actually, that’s pretty much it.</p>

    <p>It seems that if we’re good utilitarians and concerned about sacrificing in order to bring greater goods for others, we should spend every moment of our day agonizing over every purchase and how it could go further than others.  But this is self-destructive and will make us less effective overall, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-03-07/tradeoffs">as Julia Wise explains</a>: “I think it’s good to go through a period of thinking that way.  Just like when you live in another country for a while you start being able to understand prices without converting back to your own currency, when you start thinking about all your spending in Vaccination Currency or Mosquito Net Currency it becomes habitual.  Your spending habits can’t help but be affected.  I also think there’s only so much grief we can carry.  I cannot go the next 70 years counting dead children on every receipt.  I would break.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/10/22/theres-something-you-need-to-know-about-the-rules/">“There’s Something You Need to Know About the Rules”</a>: “This suggestion seemed to bring him great unease. The instructions were telling him to write his story in the notebook, and he had clearly written his on the paper instead. He was in violation of The Rules, and this was scaring him.  I suddenly realized I had some teaching to do. It was time to share a deeper explanation of what The Rules really are, and I thought you might want to join in for the session as well. Because if you look around carefully, you will see that most of the problems of our society are based upon an incorrect understanding of these rules.”</p>

<p>“4:33” is a piece of music by John Cage that consists entirely of silence.  It’s available on iTunes.  The real question is <a href="http://whywereason.com/2011/07/29/why-youll-pay-for-silence-john-cages-433/">why would people buy it?</a>.  The answer is a tale of how we don’t value things solely for what they do, but also for their history.</p>

<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/5r6/spend_money_on_ergonomics/">It seems like it could be more worthwhile than commonly thought to spend money on improving one’s ergonomics</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>My birthday is December 11. Christmas, my December holiday of choice, is December 25. I’ve heard that some people want to get me gifts for these two holidays. If you’re one of these people, here’s a list of things I would like, in my order of preference!</p>

<p><strong>1.) Donations to <a href="http://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a>.</strong>  GiveDirectly is a new charity that will take any cash you donate it and give it directly, no strings attached, to extremely poor families in Africa.  Surprisingly, they’ve found that such transfers result in useful spending like buying food, investing in their homes, paying school fees, or increasing their savings.  Very few recipients use it on alcohol or tobacco.</p>

<p>GiveDirectly has been thoroughly vetted and is supported by <a href="http://www.givedirectly.org/evidence.php">multiple studies</a> and is currently one of the three top recommendations of <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, a very selective independent charity evaluator.  Additionally, the foundation <a href="http://www.goodventures.org">Good Ventures</a> has promised to <a href="http://www.goodventures.org/about-us/press/good-ventures-announces-5-million-in-matching-funds-for-givedirectly">match any donation to GiveDirectly</a> up to $100K, so any donation you give will be doubled!</p>

<p>To be honest, I already have lots of the things I need or the means to get them for myself.  I’m really excited about the opportunity to make a true difference in the world via GiveDirectly and would greatly prefer a donation here more than any other gift.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to donate to GiveDirectly, here are some books I really would like to get:</p>

<p><strong>2.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GSZZ24">The Charisma Myth: How Anyone Can Master the Art and Science of Personal Magnetism</a> by Olivia Fox Cabane.</strong>  I like receiving books and don’t mind if they’re used, as long as they’re still legible!</p>

<p>3.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307956393">Decisive: How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work</a> by Chip and Dan Heath.</p>

<p>4.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JH8MHO">The Copywriter’s Handbook, Third Edition: A Step-By-Step Guide To Writing Copy That Sells</a> by Robert W. Bly.</p>

<p>5.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1848728859">The Science of Giving: Experimental Approaches to the Study of Charity</a> by 
Daniel M. Oppenheimer and Christopher Y. Olivol.</p>

<p>Last year, two readers of my blog reached out and bought me a book from my list.  I totally don’t expect that, but if you do want to do this for some reason, feel free to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/contact/">contact me</a> for shipping information.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Think you have what it takes to make good predictions?  Since 2011, the <a href="http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/">Good Judgment Project</a> (GJP) has been making predictions on issues of international relations and foreign affairs, recently winning the IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) prediction contest.  Predictions from the GJP have been startlingly accurate, outperforming prediction markets, and exceeding even optimistic expectations.  It’s run by Phillip Tetlock, the famous predictor of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691128715">“foxes and hedgehogs” fame</a>.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/26/good-judgment-in-forecasting-international-affairs-and-an-invitation-for-season-3/">the Monkey Cage article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does the Good Judgment Project achieve such strikingly accurate results? The Project uses modern social-science methods ranging from harnessing the wisdom of crowds to prediction markets to putting together teams of forecasters. The GJP research team attributes its success to a blend of getting the right people (i.e., the “right” individual forecasters) on the bus, offering basic tutorials on inferential traps to avoid and best practices to embrace, concentrating the most talented forecasters into super teams, and constantly fine-tuning the aggregation algorithms it uses to combine individual forecasts into a collective prediction on each forecasting question. The Project’s best forecasters are typically talented and highly motivated amateurs, rather than subject matter experts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the good news is that you now have a chance to get involved with GJP Season 3 if you think you’re a great predictor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you enjoy world politics and appreciate a good challenge, consider joining the Good Judgment Project, which has openings right now for Season 3 forecasters. The Project will give you the opportunity to receive training, to get regular feedback on your forecasting accuracy, and to test your forecasting skills against those of some of the most accurate forecasters around. Interested? To find out more and to register, go to <a href="http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/">www.goodjudgmentproject.com</a>.</p>

I do <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/category/resolutions/">monthly reviews</a> to track my adherence to important habits.  However, now I’d like to do something still a bit new – a <em>six-month</em> review that basically checks to make sure everything is going to plan from an even higher, more abstract level of review.
