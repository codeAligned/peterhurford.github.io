    <p>So, the blog went dead again, which means it’s time to revive the blog with a run-down of all the non-blog things I’ve been doing recently.</p>

<p><strong>I finished my seventh semester of college,</strong> which means I only have one more semester to go.  I’m now on Winter Break, which means I get a free month to do whatever I want.  This (probably) means more blogging!</p>

<p><strong>I’ve done a lot <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-have-i-been-doing-ii/">more of the same</a></strong> – more career work (I have exciting news on this front forthcoming!), more EA projects work (we’re called <a href="http://www.dotimpact.im">.impact</a> now), more volunteering (though I’ve now stopped working with Giving What We Can in order to focus more on other projects), and more learning programming (this week is the last week of the R course!).</p>

<p>Actually, that’s pretty much it.</p>

    <p>It seems that if we’re good utilitarians and concerned about sacrificing in order to bring greater goods for others, we should spend every moment of our day agonizing over every purchase and how it could go further than others.  But this is self-destructive and will make us less effective overall, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-03-07/tradeoffs">as Julia Wise explains</a>: “I think it’s good to go through a period of thinking that way.  Just like when you live in another country for a while you start being able to understand prices without converting back to your own currency, when you start thinking about all your spending in Vaccination Currency or Mosquito Net Currency it becomes habitual.  Your spending habits can’t help but be affected.  I also think there’s only so much grief we can carry.  I cannot go the next 70 years counting dead children on every receipt.  I would break.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/10/22/theres-something-you-need-to-know-about-the-rules/">“There’s Something You Need to Know About the Rules”</a>: “This suggestion seemed to bring him great unease. The instructions were telling him to write his story in the notebook, and he had clearly written his on the paper instead. He was in violation of The Rules, and this was scaring him.  I suddenly realized I had some teaching to do. It was time to share a deeper explanation of what The Rules really are, and I thought you might want to join in for the session as well. Because if you look around carefully, you will see that most of the problems of our society are based upon an incorrect understanding of these rules.”</p>

<p>“4:33” is a piece of music by John Cage that consists entirely of silence.  It’s available on iTunes.  The real question is <a href="http://whywereason.com/2011/07/29/why-youll-pay-for-silence-john-cages-433/">why would people buy it?</a>.  The answer is a tale of how we don’t value things solely for what they do, but also for their history.</p>

<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/5r6/spend_money_on_ergonomics/">It seems like it could be more worthwhile than commonly thought to spend money on improving one’s ergonomics</a>.

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>My birthday is December 11. Christmas, my December holiday of choice, is December 25. I’ve heard that some people want to get me gifts for these two holidays. If you’re one of these people, here’s a list of things I would like, in my order of preference!</p>

<p><strong>1.) Donations to <a href="http://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a>.</strong>  GiveDirectly is a new charity that will take any cash you donate it and give it directly, no strings attached, to extremely poor families in Africa.  Surprisingly, they’ve found that such transfers result in useful spending like buying food, investing in their homes, paying school fees, or increasing their savings.  Very few recipients use it on alcohol or tobacco.</p>

<p>GiveDirectly has been thoroughly vetted and is supported by <a href="http://www.givedirectly.org/evidence.php">multiple studies</a> and is currently one of the three top recommendations of <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, a very selective independent charity evaluator.  Additionally, the foundation <a href="http://www.goodventures.org">Good Ventures</a> has promised to <a href="http://www.goodventures.org/about-us/press/good-ventures-announces-5-million-in-matching-funds-for-givedirectly">match any donation to GiveDirectly</a> up to $100K, so any donation you give will be doubled!</p>

<p>To be honest, I already have lots of the things I need or the means to get them for myself.  I’m really excited about the opportunity to make a true difference in the world via GiveDirectly and would greatly prefer a donation here more than any other gift.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to donate to GiveDirectly, here are some books I really would like to get:</p>

<p><strong>2.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GSZZ24">The Charisma Myth: How Anyone Can Master the Art and Science of Personal Magnetism</a> by Olivia Fox Cabane.</strong>  I like receiving books and don’t mind if they’re used, as long as they’re still legible!</p>

<p>3.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307956393">Decisive: How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work</a> by Chip and Dan Heath.</p>

<p>4.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JH8MHO">The Copywriter’s Handbook, Third Edition: A Step-By-Step Guide To Writing Copy That Sells</a> by Robert W. Bly.</p>

<p>5.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1848728859">The Science of Giving: Experimental Approaches to the Study of Charity</a> by 
Daniel M. Oppenheimer and Christopher Y. Olivol.</p>

<p>Last year, two readers of my blog reached out and bought me a book from my list.  I totally don’t expect that, but if you do want to do this for some reason, feel free to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/contact/">contact me</a> for shipping information.</p>

    <p>Think you have what it takes to make good predictions?  Since 2011, the <a href="http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/">Good Judgment Project</a> (GJP) has been making predictions on issues of international relations and foreign affairs, recently winning the IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) prediction contest.  Predictions from the GJP have been startlingly accurate, outperforming prediction markets, and exceeding even optimistic expectations.  It’s run by Phillip Tetlock, the famous predictor of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691128715">“foxes and hedgehogs” fame</a>.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/26/good-judgment-in-forecasting-international-affairs-and-an-invitation-for-season-3/">the Monkey Cage article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does the Good Judgment Project achieve such strikingly accurate results? The Project uses modern social-science methods ranging from harnessing the wisdom of crowds to prediction markets to putting together teams of forecasters. The GJP research team attributes its success to a blend of getting the right people (i.e., the “right” individual forecasters) on the bus, offering basic tutorials on inferential traps to avoid and best practices to embrace, concentrating the most talented forecasters into super teams, and constantly fine-tuning the aggregation algorithms it uses to combine individual forecasts into a collective prediction on each forecasting question. The Project’s best forecasters are typically talented and highly motivated amateurs, rather than subject matter experts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the good news is that you now have a chance to get involved with GJP Season 3 if you think you’re a great predictor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you enjoy world politics and appreciate a good challenge, consider joining the Good Judgment Project, which has openings right now for Season 3 forecasters. The Project will give you the opportunity to receive training, to get regular feedback on your forecasting accuracy, and to test your forecasting skills against those of some of the most accurate forecasters around. Interested? To find out more and to register, go to <a href="http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/">www.goodjudgmentproject.com</a>.</p>

I do <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/category/resolutions/">monthly reviews</a> to track my adherence to important habits.  However, now I’d like to do something still a bit new – a <em>six-month</em> review that basically checks to make sure everything is going to plan from an even higher, more abstract level of review.

    <p>You may (hopefully) have noticed that this blog has died out again.  Maybe you’ve even come to miss it.  After all, in past years, I’ve spent November doing <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> for my blog (see <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/the-nanowrimo-reflection">2011</a> and <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/the-nanowrimo-2012-reflection">2012</a>), but this year I’ve done nothing blog-wise.</p>

<p>So what have I been doing, behind the scenes, while not blogging?  I’ll tell you!

    <p>An interesting way to <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/variable-pricing">use variable pricing to allow trade-offs between time and money</a>:  “Mary puts up three signs on the side of the truck: $2, $3, and $5. As people come for pizza she asks them to make three lines, one for each sign, based on how much they want to pay. […] The $2 line is long[. …] Some people would rather have pizza sooner than money and wait in the $3 line. […] Mary makes more money, the people who can afford to pay less get cheaper pizza, and the people in a hurry now have an option to trade off time and money.”</p>

<p>When saying there’s “no evidence” for something, keep in mind that there are actually <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/08/doctor-there-ar.html">two kinds of “no evidence”</a> – either no evidence has turned up despite looking really hard with the right methods or no evidence has come up yet because no one has bothered to look.  Only the first one is necessarily damning to a hypothesis.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrVlq2AgwyA">The Kaye effect</a> is pretty cool: “They have made a video of leaping shampoo, in which they explain the so-called Kaye effect.  Kaye in Nature magazine in 1963 wrote ‘I can offer no explanation for this behaviour.’  At high-speed recording of 1000 frames per second the following observations were made in 300ms interval: 1) a heap is formed, 2) a streamer ejects, 3) the outgoing jet rises, 4) hits the incoming jet, 5) ends the Kaye effect.”</p>

<p>Cal Newport writes about how you can find pretty amazing-sounding accomplishments by <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/08/21/do-you-want-to-succeed-in-college-admissions-finish-something/">just doing something interesting and follow through</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a hard problem, one way to solve it is to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/7t2/hard_problem_hack_away_at_the_edges/">hack away at the edges</a>, working on subproblems until something comes up.</p>

<p><a href="http://countinganimals.com/factory-farming-and-the-price-of-meat/">Factory farming doesn’t actually reduce the price of meat</a>.  While factory farming does reduce the cost it takes to produce meat, producers are keeping the extra savings as profit and not reducing prices.</p>

<p>From the department of audacious philanthropy, this family <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/opinion/24kristof.html?_r=2&amp;">sold their house and donated half of the proceeds</a> and bought a smaller house.</p>

<p>The Battle of Hoth proves that both the Rebels and the Empire are <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/battle-of-hoth/">complete, total idiots when it comes to military strategy</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Jeremy Lauer is a researcher at WHO-CHOICE, a project of the World Health Organization to encourage cost-effectiveness via both research and communication with policy-makers Rob Wiblin and I sat down to interview Jeremy and learn about WHO-CHOICE, a potentially promising career path for 80,000 Hours members interested in promoting cost-effectiveness research - one of our high priority causes to investigate.</p>

<p>Jeremy’s main points were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>WHO-CHOICE is about giving countries the tools needed to establish priorities in the health sector and make good, high-impact-for-money policy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The landscape of global public health is starting to shift to a time where, more and more, “best buys” and “magic-bullet solutions” such as vaccines are fully funded. This is exciting because it means people are getting important treatments, but it is also daunting because the next generation of interventions will involve more complex technical work and clearer communication with the public.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a strong economics background, are quantitatively minded, and also have interests in epidemiology, biostatistics, or computer programming, a career at WHO-CHOICE or a similar organization could be rewarding and impactful.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <p><em>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-morality/">“What is Morality”</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>What is this?</strong></p>

<p>This is an essay where I explain my opinions on meta-ethics through a guided discussion with a hypothetical inquisitor.  It seemed like a much easier, more efficient, and more fluid format than writing a dozen tinier essays.  The only downside is at 4797 words, it’s a bit lengthy…
