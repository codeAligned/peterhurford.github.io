    <p>As Peter Singer writes in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400067103"><strong>The Life You Can Save</strong></a>: “[t]he world would be a much simpler place if one could bring about social change merely by making a logically consistent moral argument”.  Many people one encounters might agree that a social change movement is noble yet not want to do anything to promote it, or want to give more money to a charity yet refrain from doing so.  Additional moralizing doesn’t seem to do the trick.  …So what does?</p>

<p>Motivating people to altruism is relevant for the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw(6).py/optimal_philanthropy_for_human_beings/">optimal philanthropy movement</a>.  For a start on the answer, like many things, I turn to psychology.  Specifically, the psychology Peter Singer catalogues in his book.

    <p>Back on <a href="http://www.greatplay.net">the old blog</a>, I ran something I called <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/category/link-roundup">the Weekly Link Roundup</a>.  I started about two years ago, and over the time, created 72 of them.  I really valued this opportunity to share links not just to spread some of the great writing and videos around, but also catalog them for my personal reference.  Here, I’m going to do the same, except it will be on Sundays.  Hence, Sunday Links.</p>

<p>Remember that I don’t necessarily agree with everything stated in every article. Feel free to comment or ask.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/344508.html">“Further Adventures in Being Biased and Bad with Money”</a>, Scott Alexander explains a bias he noticed where he’d rather pay $200 for a flight with free internet and food than $150 for a flight where you have to pay $10 each for internet and food.  It’s a bias that sounds really weird when I say it, but that I totally fall for in real life and would be worth exploring further.  I think it’s a matter of how people construct “mental buckets” for spending, and $200 is totally reasonable for your “flight” bucket the same way $150 is, but $10 is not reasonable for your “food” bucket.  Same reason why people will travel several miles to save $10 on gasoline, but not travel several miles to save $10 on a car.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, here are <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/09/9-ways-marketing-weasels-will-try-to-manipulate-you.html">“Nine Ways Marketing Weasels Will Try to Manipulate You”</a>, based on biases like that.  Pricing bias is the most scary.  But watch out for the mentions that “rationality can be cold, unemotional, and bad” (<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/90n/summary_of_the_straw_vulcan/">straw vulcanism</a>) at the bottom of the essay.

    <p>This website is about things that have worked <em>for me</em>.  The “for me” part is key.  This website isn’t about giving you advice, as much as I want other people to share in my lifestyle choices.  Why?  Well, first, I’m not nearly experienced enough to offer you advice.  But second, <strong>the advice probably won’t work.</strong></p>

<p>I have a theory, which <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/9v/beware_of_otheroptimizing/">Eliezer Yudkowsky also discovered</a>, that many people will hunt through the web looking for tips on something: how to run, how to make a to-do list, etc., that optimize some part of their life.  They’ll consider, say, five or six different approaches, and then they’ll finally find the one <em>that works</em>.  And this is a magical moment that must be shared with everyone, because your dedication has unveiled the one method <em>that works</em>, and you can save everyone the time of trying the five other approaches that <em>don’t work</em>.</p>

<p>…Except you missed a step. You forgot to take into account that while people are rather similar, there’s enough individual differences in what people prefer, what makes people comfortable, how people think about things, etc., that what works for you <em>might not work for other people</em>.  Indeed, all six of the approaches you consider probably have each worked for <em>someone</em> at one point or another, <em>or they wouldn’t have been written about in the first place</em>.  No one, I hope, writes about failed self-improvement methods, unless… well… it’s about how those methods have failed.

    <p>One hundred twenty-six days ago, I was overweight.  I was 6’1” and 220lbs. I needed to do something, so I turned to was exercise.  I started out trying to run.  I could barely run half a mile before I got winded and had to stop.  I couldn’t keep going.  Now, 126 days later, I have run my first 5k.  I didn’t do an official 5k or anything.  I just ran the 5k distance (3.1 miles) – run away from my house, go 1.55 miles down the street, turn around, and run 1.55 miles back.</p>

<p>I had never run a 5k before.  I had once been very close.  I got all the way to 2.7 miles.  But then I got injured for a week, sick for another week, and didn’t run for almost all of March.  I tried running again after that, but I got tired after running just a mile, and I stopped.  Eventually, after a bit more practice I worked my way back to being able to run 1.5 miles, but it still wasn’t going well.  I was a long way away from being able to break the 5k barrier.

    <p>Hi.</p>

<p>My name is Peter Hurford.  Right now, I’m a software developer at <a href="http://www.avantcredit.com">Avant Credit</a>, an online loan start-up in Chicago, IL.  I’ve been enjoying the big city.  Back in May 2014, I graduated from Denison University](http://www.denison.edu/), a small liberal arts college a little bit outside Columbus OH, with dual degrees in political science and psychology, and a concentration in organizational studies.  If you want to know more about me as a professional, I have a personal website located at <a href="http://www.peterhurford.com">PeterHurford.com</a>.</p>

<p>I used to write a blog called <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/">Greatplay.net</a> for many years, starting blogging in 2009.  In the fall of 2010, I read Richard Carrier’s <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1420802933">Sense and Goodness Without God</a></strong> and Nicholas Everitt’s <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0415301068">The Nonexistence of God</a></strong>.  I can’t say that I believed in God prior to reading these books, but I definitely didn’t believe in God after reading these books, and I promptly shifted my blog to a large discussion of why that was the case.  Philosophy of religion mattered a lot to me then, and I wrote about it frequently.  Around this time, I got involved with the community website <a href="http://www.lesswrong.com">Less Wrong</a>.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2011, things changed again.  I read Peter Singer’s <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400067103">The Life You Can Save</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061711306">Animal Liberation</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521707684">Practical Ethics</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0879759666">How Are We to Live</a></strong>.  For the second time in my life, reading books changed everything.  I continued to see some harm in religion, but this was dwarfed dramatically by the harms that come from factory farming and income inequality.  I almost immediately resolved to stop eating meat and donate some of my income to <a href="http://www.givewell.org">effective non-profits in the third world</a>.</p>

<p>Over the summer of 2012, I got involved in <a href="http://www.felicifia.org">Felicifia</a>, a utilitarian forum, and spoke to many of the people there.  I joined <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> a little later, and pledged to donate 10% of my income.  I kept reading books and learning more about organizations not just working to make the world a better place, but <em>best</em> make the world the <em>best</em> place – a movement called <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/what-effective-altruism">effective altruism</a>.</p>

<p>Now, in the summer of 2013, I decided that it’s time to re-invent my blog and dedicate it to exploring these big issues in life.  Therefore, you get <strong>Everyday Utilitarian</strong>, or my blog dedicated to my quest to become just that… an everyday utilitarian, or someone who seeks to put utilitarianism into their everyday life.  This blog will definitely focus on the abstract debates you frequently see on philosophy blogs.  But it will be a bit more than that.  There will be self-improvement and lifestyle building as I craft my everyday utilitarianism.  And there will be some discussion of science as it can help build utilitarian communities and answer deep questions about ethics.  And there will be political commentary from my utilitarian perspective.</p>

<p>There are other self-improvement sites out there.  But I don’t have all the answers, and I’m not out to give you advice.  Instead, this blog is a personal blog about a journey, where I work on my life and give you updates on how things are going.  And it’s about a particular kind of life – one that seeks to put utilitarianism into practice and make the world a better place.  Hopefully you’ll take something out of it and enjoy it.</p>

<p>Let me know.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I consider myself a utilitarian.  I’m not a perfect one, and I don’t think people have to be.  However, before I focus on that, I’d like to focus on what “utilitarianism” means.  When I say I’m a utilitarian, I’m saying that I have set out to make the world a better place, to the best of my ability.  And by better place, I’m talking about a world where there everyone is better off than they were earlier.</p>

<p>Utilitarianism is a moral theory that says that one should aim to “maximize utility” whenever possible.  What counts as “utility” is still more or less open for debate, but it can be thought of as “happiness”, “flourishing”, “well-being”, “welfare”, “pleasure”, or “life satisfaction”.  These are all tricky concepts and I’ll tend to use them interchangably, but this isn’t to side-step an important debate about their differences and distinctions.  Luckily for us, however, except in strange scenarios, everyone agrees on what makes things better for the most part.  If Joan is suffering from malaria, it would be better to cure her disease.  If Roger is living on $1 a day, it would be better to lift him out of poverty.  It doesn’t matter whether we’re talking about happiness, flourishing, or pleasure… we should do these things.</p>

<p>When I think of utilitarianism, I think of three things: equality for all, only welfare matters, and we must act on our priorities.
