  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Welcome to the fourth edition of Sunday Links!</p>

<p>In this edition, I’m going to focus on the exploration of “earning to give”.  You know how some people talk about “doing well by doing good”?  Well “earning to give” is basically “doing good by doing well” – you look specifically for a high paying job in order to earn a lot of money, and then use your large disposable income to donate to charity.</p>

<p>For instance, one might think to join a non-profit and do important work and earn a salary of $30K.  Or, one might instead choose to become a banker or stock trader, earn $100K+, keep the same salary of $30K, and and donate the $70K+ and hire <em>two or more</em> charity workers to serve in their place.  Chances are good that those two charity workers who displace you will do more good combined than you will have done if you worked in their place, and that you displaced someone who would have joined finance but not donated their money.</p>

<p>As Jeff Kaufman <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-03-11">considers summarizing it</a>, the idea is to “[g]ive money to the most effective charities, and maximize your impact by earning more and spending less.””  A basic introduction of this idea can be found in the <a href="http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give">80000 Hours topic</a> and <a href="http://80000hours.org/faq#faq-what-is-earning-to-give">corresponding FAQ</a>.  Brian Tomasik also has a pretty thorough summary of the idea in <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html">“Why Activists Should Consider Making Lots of Money”</a>.</p>

<h2 id="popular-press-objections-and-rebuttals">Popular Press, Objections, and Rebuttals</h2>

<p>This idea has taken to popular press over the years, with <a href="http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2011/11/banking-as-an-ethical-career/">an article on Practical Ethics</a>, <a href="http://qz.com/57254/to-save-the-world-dont-get-a-job-at-a-charity-go-work-on-wall-street/">Quartz</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15820786">BBC</a>, and recently <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/?tid=ts_carousel">The Washington Post</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2334682/Young-professionals-joining-Wall-Street-save-world.html">Daily Mail</a>.</p>

<p>The Washington Post article in particular prompted people to write in some criticism, including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?_r=1">a column from David Brooks</a>.  Brooks argues that (1) you risk losing your motivation and (2) you risk not living a sufficiently “full” life.  Alexander Berger <a href="http://marginalchange.blogspot.ca/2013/06/2013-david-brooks-vs-2011-david-brooks.html">responds</a>, pointing out that burnout is a risk, but the motivations of those people earning to give are definitely there and that they are living “full” lives.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/349841/rise-singerians-reihan-salam">objection in the National Review</a> that suggests “earning to give” favors individual action and ignores the good that can come from public action.  This is <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage">responded to by 80,000 Hours</a>, which says it’s a political point being read that doesn’t actually exist.</p>

<p>Ben Kuhn <a href="http://www.benkuhn.net/etg-objections">looks at more objections</a> that surfaced in the comments sections of various articles, and he finds that people object to (1) some “earning to give” careers (like banking) doing bad by promoting negative capitalist systems, (2) that where “earning to give” people are giving (mostly the <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com">Against Malaria Foundation</a> ignores focusing on “root causes” in favor of addressing symptoms, and (3) general objections to utilitarianism.  Kuhn addresses those arguments in that article.</p>

<p>Jeff Kaufman also looks at objections to banking as a career and <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-06-03">proposes we talk about other careers instead</a>, like computer programming, teacher, or social worker.  Julia Wise writes about <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/whats-it-like-to-give-half.html">how she could still “earn to give” on a $38K salary</a>.</p>

<h2 id="but-is-earning-to-give-actually-a-good-idea">But is “Earning to Give” Actually a Good Idea?</h2>

<p>So all this is great, and I’m glad there’s a big conversation now on effectiveness and considering career choice as an ethical question.  However, while the level of criticism I’ve seen in the popular press isn’t great, there definitely are objections to “earning to give” that matter.</p>

<p><strong>First, I think the issue of burnout is considered by those who think about “earning to give”, but never directly addressed.</strong>  How many people pursuing “earning to give” end up burning out?   And what happens then?  Can one really choose <em>any</em> high-earning career and do well at it, or does one also need some sort of direct passion for the job?</p>

<p><strong>Second, can’t there be more beneficial careers than “earning to give”?</strong> Generally, I agree with <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage">80,000 Hours’s response</a> and <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-03-02">Jeff Kaufman’s consideration</a> that “earning to give” is a <em>baseline</em>, not the best option.  It’s a useful and powerful point of comparison to ask “Is what I’m doing better than just earning a higher salary and donating it?”.</p>

<p>Frequently, however, I think this baseline can be beaten.  While there’s a “make more money to donate” side of things, there’s also a “make the donated money work better” side, working in the organizations themselves to increase the impact of each donation by increasing the impact of the organizations themselves.  As Jeff Kaufman records in <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-05-20">“Talent or Money”</a>, some organizations like <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> probably would benefit more from additional talent than additional money.  In <a href="http://www.effective-altruism.com/node/31">“Earning to Give vs. Altruistic Career Choice Revisited”</a>, Jonah Sinick discusses that consideration among a few others.</p>

<p>Overall, the career you choose is an incredibly important choice to consider not just from a personal perspective, but from an ethical perspective.  But it’s also a very individual choice and the good one can do with their career and the satisfaction they can get out of it depend immensely on one’s individual talents and desires.  Therefore, a would-be career do-gooder should instead try to find individualized advice (such as that offered by <a href="http://www.80000hours.org">80000 Hours</a>) and consider a wider variety of careers.</p>

    <p>In Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em>, Odysseus’s crew sailed past the island of the Sirens. In Greek lore, the Sirens were notorious for singing a song so enchanting that those who listened would sail toward the Sirens and end up crashing into the rocks, sealing their own fate.</p>

<p>The common solution of the era was to avoid listening to the song altogether – plugging one’s ears with beeswax. But Odysseus wanted to listen to the song… though, of course, he didn’t want to end up crashing his ship and killing his crew.</p>

<p>Thus, not trusting his future willpower, Odysseus had his crew tie him to the mast of the ship and precommitted to not be let go. Predictably, when he heard the song he begged to be released, but his crew followed his earlier orders and didn’t let him go. Odysseus survived on the basis of precommitment1.

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>For the past two years, the only place I ate meat was at home with my family.  As of October 2012, I’ve finally stopped eating meat altogether and can’t see a reason why I would want to go back to eating meat.  This kind of attitude toward eating is commonly classified as “vegetarianism” where one refrains from eating the flesh of all animals, including fish, but still will consume animal products like eggs and milk (though I try to avoid egg as best I can).</p>

<p>Why might I want to do this?  And why might I see it as a serious issue?  It’s because I’m very concerned about the reality of suffering done to our “food animals” in the process of making them into meat, because I see vegetarianism as a way to reduce this suffering by stopping the harmful process, and because vegetarianism has not been hard at all for me to accomplish.

<p>More than five months ago, I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions">outlined some New Years Resolutions</a>, and then did what I thought impossible – used the power of blogging, precommitment, and betting to <em>actually stick to my plans</em>.

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Welcome to the third edition of Sunday Links!  This time, I want to explore links on one particular concept: <em>effective altruism</em>, a concept near and dear to both my heart and utilitarianism.</p>

<p>Peter Singer summarizes effective altruism <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Diuv3XZQXyc">in his recent TED Talk</a>.</p>

<p>What’s the key idea?  Will Crouch <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/node/4">defines effective altruism</a> as starting with a “how” (a desire to do as much good as possible) and moving to a “what” (whatever does the most good), instead of the typical model of altruism, which starts with a “what” (ending cancer) and moving to a “how” (whatever campaigns end cancer).  It’s very closely related to the idea of <a href="http://www.tacticalphilanthropy.com/2010/10/the-rise-of-issue-agnostic-philanthropy/">issue-agnostic philanthropy</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest take away is that philanthropy involves trade-offs, because donating in one place means we’re not donating in another place.  However, because our money could have gone further elsewhere, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">we end up hurting people unintentionally</a>.  My favorite case for understanding the need for effective altruism involves Scott Siskind’s <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/">summary of efficient charity</a>, which I referenced before.  To make the idea of opportunity costs in spending apparent, Scott Siskind also jokingly suggests <a href="http://www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html">we adopt dead child currency</a>.</p>

<p>One example of effective altruism is to <a href="http://www.givewell.org/want-to-change-peoples-lives-give-internationally">focus more on the developing world than on the developed world</a>.  This might seem unintuitive at first, but when I think about it <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/49-on-triage">in terms of triage</a> or Julia Wise’s <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2012/02/our-worst-subjects.html">notion of worst subjects</a>, it makes sense to me.  Jeff Kaufman’s <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2011-10-15">debate with a pro-local friend of his</a> also helps.</p>

<p>But wouldn’t this be really hard?  Well, the secret is that <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/why-give/how-rich-am-i">we’re rich</a>, compared to the developing world.  But even so, <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/03/it-doesnt-have-to-be-hard.html">it doesn’t have to be hard</a>.  You could just start <em>somewhere</em>, for some amount.</p>

<p>Where should you start?  I recommend a few places, like <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com">The Life You Can Save</a>, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>. <a href="http://80000hours.org">80000 Hours</a>, and <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/">Effective Animal Activism</a>.</p>

<p>There’s much more that needs to be said, but this should be enough to get you going.  A whole world of helping more by “working smarter, not harder” awaits.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">previously mentioned</a> that individuals can make a large difference in the lives of others through donations, as long as they choose very cost-effective charities.  However, while our donation does make a difference to a few people, there are much more massive institutions working to make much bigger differences in the well-being of those in other countries – <em>foreign aid</em>.</p>

<p>Foreign aid aims to eliminate extreme hunger, extreme poverty, and disease from the world altogether and usher everyone into lives in which they can be happy and live to their potential.  Because foreign aid is perhaps the biggest attempt to make the world a better place, it is important to me that we get this right.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we haven’t gotten it right quite yet.  Fifty years of foreign aid efforts later, and extreme poverty, extreme hunger, and disease still exist.  While it may seem wildly idealistic to believe that extreme poverty, extreme hunger, and disease can be eliminated soon, Peter Singer in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-You-Can-Save/dp/1400067103"><strong>The Life You Can Save</strong></a> argues that the elimination of all three plights is within our reach if only we studied foreign aid, looked at its failures, and made some modifications.  In this essay, I explore his chapter on foreign aid.

    <p>Imagine you came across a store offering the following options:</p>

<p><strong>Blue Coffee Mug:</strong> $1</p>

<p><strong>Red Coffee Mug:</strong> $1050</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>After thorough inspection, you discover that both mugs are of precisely equal quality.  The only difference in the mugs is their color.  Which would you rather buy?</p>

<p>…I think nearly every person would — if they had to make the choice — prefer to buy the blue coffee mug. Even if red is your favorite color and the red coffee mugs are so more stylish than blue ones, the thousand-fold difference in the price just doesn’t seem to cut it, and red wins out in a landslide.</p>

<p>Now why does this matter?  Because, I’d argue, the same kind of decisions are made when we donate, except most people make little effort to figure out which coffee mug is which.  And instead of the downside being wasting your own money on a coffee mug that is far too expensive, <strong>the downside of this mistake is that people die who otherwise wouldn’t have to.</strong>

    <p>Welcome to the second edition of Sunday Links!  These are links!  And this is posted on a Sunday!  Makes sense so far, right?  As a reminder, I may not agree with everything said in all of these links.</p>

<p>…Positional goods are things you spend money on solely to prove how rich you are.  For example, buying a $2000 watch that isn’t any better than a $100 one.  <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-moral-shortcomings-of-conspicuous-consumption-by-peter-singer">Peter Singer reminds us that such spending is somewhere between entirely wasteful and terribly evil</a>.  I wish more people could just go back to proving how rich they are by blowing it on ineffective philanthropy, because then it hopefully will take a lot less work to get them to channel it into effective philanthropy.</p>

<p>…In other Singer news, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEulhlGgskc">Peter Singer gives a talk about effective altruism</a>.  Luckily someone recorded it and put it on YouTube.  …Too many of these awesome lectures aren’t on YouTube.</p>

<p>….There’s <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2012/08/13/live-by-statistics-die-by-statistics/">something a little suspicious</a> about the p&lt;0.05 threshold.  Feel free to ignore this if you don’t know what “p&lt;0.05” means, but definitely read this if you do.  It’s for us statistics people.  Speaking of which, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/nobel-laureate-challenges-psychologists-to-clean-up-their-act-1.11535">psychology might be screwed</a> for similar reasons.

    <p>Many people think it would be nicer if people were to give more money to non-profits, especially effective ones.  However, for most people, it doesn’t even occur to them that they giving a large share of their salary to charity is something that people actually can do, or <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">that people are doing on a regular basis</a>.</p>

<p>Being public with one’s pledge to donate not only spreads information about how easy it is to fight global poverty with a serious commitment, but that such commitments are the kind of thing that people can actually take.  By being public with these pledges, we can actually inspire people to give, where they otherwise wouldn’t.</p>

<p>But how did people get stuck in a rut?  Why doesn’t giving money come naturally?  And how would public declarations help dig people out of this rut?

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I’ve noticed that quite a few people are interested in fostering communities – both creating communities and improving them to make them work together.  But how do we go about actually doing this?  What’s there to community that we can foster and build upon?  What makes a community thrive, and how do we take advantage of this to make and/or improve communities?</p>

<p>To answer these questions, I turned to two books:</p>

<p>The first is <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385525761">The Penguin and The Leviathan: How Cooperation Triumphs Over Self-Interest</a></strong> by Yochai Benkler.  Benkler, in writing about cooperative systems (Penguins, named after the Linux Penguin) and hierarchical systems (Leviathans, named after Thomas Hobbes’s The Leviathan), studies the psychology, economics, and political science of cooperation and helps explain what makes communities stick.</p>

<p>The second is <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1118143302">Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive</a></strong> by Bruce Schneier.  Schneier studies trust and cooperation from a dizzying variety of sciences (psychology, biology, economics, anthropology, computer science, and political science).  Schneier’s ultimate game is figuring out what is preventing society from falling apart, and that can be applied to building communities.</p>

<p>Let’s see what they got.
