  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Welcome to the third edition of Sunday Links!  This time, I want to explore links on one particular concept: <em>effective altruism</em>, a concept near and dear to both my heart and utilitarianism.</p>

<p>Peter Singer summarizes effective altruism <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Diuv3XZQXyc">in his recent TED Talk</a>.</p>

<p>What’s the key idea?  Will Crouch <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/node/4">defines effective altruism</a> as starting with a “how” (a desire to do as much good as possible) and moving to a “what” (whatever does the most good), instead of the typical model of altruism, which starts with a “what” (ending cancer) and moving to a “how” (whatever campaigns end cancer).  It’s very closely related to the idea of <a href="http://www.tacticalphilanthropy.com/2010/10/the-rise-of-issue-agnostic-philanthropy/">issue-agnostic philanthropy</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest take away is that philanthropy involves trade-offs, because donating in one place means we’re not donating in another place.  However, because our money could have gone further elsewhere, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">we end up hurting people unintentionally</a>.  My favorite case for understanding the need for effective altruism involves Scott Siskind’s <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/">summary of efficient charity</a>, which I referenced before.  To make the idea of opportunity costs in spending apparent, Scott Siskind also jokingly suggests <a href="http://www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html">we adopt dead child currency</a>.</p>

<p>One example of effective altruism is to <a href="http://www.givewell.org/want-to-change-peoples-lives-give-internationally">focus more on the developing world than on the developed world</a>.  This might seem unintuitive at first, but when I think about it <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/49-on-triage">in terms of triage</a> or Julia Wise’s <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2012/02/our-worst-subjects.html">notion of worst subjects</a>, it makes sense to me.  Jeff Kaufman’s <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2011-10-15">debate with a pro-local friend of his</a> also helps.</p>

<p>But wouldn’t this be really hard?  Well, the secret is that <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/why-give/how-rich-am-i">we’re rich</a>, compared to the developing world.  But even so, <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/03/it-doesnt-have-to-be-hard.html">it doesn’t have to be hard</a>.  You could just start <em>somewhere</em>, for some amount.</p>

<p>Where should you start?  I recommend a few places, like <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com">The Life You Can Save</a>, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>. <a href="http://80000hours.org">80000 Hours</a>, and <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/">Effective Animal Activism</a>.</p>

<p>There’s much more that needs to be said, but this should be enough to get you going.  A whole world of helping more by “working smarter, not harder” awaits.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">previously mentioned</a> that individuals can make a large difference in the lives of others through donations, as long as they choose very cost-effective charities.  However, while our donation does make a difference to a few people, there are much more massive institutions working to make much bigger differences in the well-being of those in other countries – <em>foreign aid</em>.</p>

<p>Foreign aid aims to eliminate extreme hunger, extreme poverty, and disease from the world altogether and usher everyone into lives in which they can be happy and live to their potential.  Because foreign aid is perhaps the biggest attempt to make the world a better place, it is important to me that we get this right.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we haven’t gotten it right quite yet.  Fifty years of foreign aid efforts later, and extreme poverty, extreme hunger, and disease still exist.  While it may seem wildly idealistic to believe that extreme poverty, extreme hunger, and disease can be eliminated soon, Peter Singer in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-You-Can-Save/dp/1400067103"><strong>The Life You Can Save</strong></a> argues that the elimination of all three plights is within our reach if only we studied foreign aid, looked at its failures, and made some modifications.  In this essay, I explore his chapter on foreign aid.

    <p>Imagine you came across a store offering the following options:</p>

<p><strong>Blue Coffee Mug:</strong> $1</p>

<p><strong>Red Coffee Mug:</strong> $1050</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>After thorough inspection, you discover that both mugs are of precisely equal quality.  The only difference in the mugs is their color.  Which would you rather buy?</p>

<p>…I think nearly every person would — if they had to make the choice — prefer to buy the blue coffee mug. Even if red is your favorite color and the red coffee mugs are so more stylish than blue ones, the thousand-fold difference in the price just doesn’t seem to cut it, and red wins out in a landslide.</p>

<p>Now why does this matter?  Because, I’d argue, the same kind of decisions are made when we donate, except most people make little effort to figure out which coffee mug is which.  And instead of the downside being wasting your own money on a coffee mug that is far too expensive, <strong>the downside of this mistake is that people die who otherwise wouldn’t have to.</strong>

    <p>Welcome to the second edition of Sunday Links!  These are links!  And this is posted on a Sunday!  Makes sense so far, right?  As a reminder, I may not agree with everything said in all of these links.</p>

<p>…Positional goods are things you spend money on solely to prove how rich you are.  For example, buying a $2000 watch that isn’t any better than a $100 one.  <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-moral-shortcomings-of-conspicuous-consumption-by-peter-singer">Peter Singer reminds us that such spending is somewhere between entirely wasteful and terribly evil</a>.  I wish more people could just go back to proving how rich they are by blowing it on ineffective philanthropy, because then it hopefully will take a lot less work to get them to channel it into effective philanthropy.</p>

<p>…In other Singer news, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEulhlGgskc">Peter Singer gives a talk about effective altruism</a>.  Luckily someone recorded it and put it on YouTube.  …Too many of these awesome lectures aren’t on YouTube.</p>

<p>….There’s <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2012/08/13/live-by-statistics-die-by-statistics/">something a little suspicious</a> about the p&lt;0.05 threshold.  Feel free to ignore this if you don’t know what “p&lt;0.05” means, but definitely read this if you do.  It’s for us statistics people.  Speaking of which, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/nobel-laureate-challenges-psychologists-to-clean-up-their-act-1.11535">psychology might be screwed</a> for similar reasons.

    <p>Many people think it would be nicer if people were to give more money to non-profits, especially effective ones.  However, for most people, it doesn’t even occur to them that they giving a large share of their salary to charity is something that people actually can do, or <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">that people are doing on a regular basis</a>.</p>

<p>Being public with one’s pledge to donate not only spreads information about how easy it is to fight global poverty with a serious commitment, but that such commitments are the kind of thing that people can actually take.  By being public with these pledges, we can actually inspire people to give, where they otherwise wouldn’t.</p>

<p>But how did people get stuck in a rut?  Why doesn’t giving money come naturally?  And how would public declarations help dig people out of this rut?

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I’ve noticed that quite a few people are interested in fostering communities – both creating communities and improving them to make them work together.  But how do we go about actually doing this?  What’s there to community that we can foster and build upon?  What makes a community thrive, and how do we take advantage of this to make and/or improve communities?</p>

<p>To answer these questions, I turned to two books:</p>

<p>The first is <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385525761">The Penguin and The Leviathan: How Cooperation Triumphs Over Self-Interest</a></strong> by Yochai Benkler.  Benkler, in writing about cooperative systems (Penguins, named after the Linux Penguin) and hierarchical systems (Leviathans, named after Thomas Hobbes’s The Leviathan), studies the psychology, economics, and political science of cooperation and helps explain what makes communities stick.</p>

<p>The second is <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1118143302">Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive</a></strong> by Bruce Schneier.  Schneier studies trust and cooperation from a dizzying variety of sciences (psychology, biology, economics, anthropology, computer science, and political science).  Schneier’s ultimate game is figuring out what is preventing society from falling apart, and that can be applied to building communities.</p>

<p>Let’s see what they got.

    <p>As Peter Singer writes in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400067103"><strong>The Life You Can Save</strong></a>: “[t]he world would be a much simpler place if one could bring about social change merely by making a logically consistent moral argument”.  Many people one encounters might agree that a social change movement is noble yet not want to do anything to promote it, or want to give more money to a charity yet refrain from doing so.  Additional moralizing doesn’t seem to do the trick.  …So what does?</p>

<p>Motivating people to altruism is relevant for the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw(6).py/optimal_philanthropy_for_human_beings/">optimal philanthropy movement</a>.  For a start on the answer, like many things, I turn to psychology.  Specifically, the psychology Peter Singer catalogues in his book.

    <p>Back on <a href="http://www.greatplay.net">the old blog</a>, I ran something I called <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/category/link-roundup">the Weekly Link Roundup</a>.  I started about two years ago, and over the time, created 72 of them.  I really valued this opportunity to share links not just to spread some of the great writing and videos around, but also catalog them for my personal reference.  Here, I’m going to do the same, except it will be on Sundays.  Hence, Sunday Links.</p>

<p>Remember that I don’t necessarily agree with everything stated in every article. Feel free to comment or ask.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/344508.html">“Further Adventures in Being Biased and Bad with Money”</a>, Scott Alexander explains a bias he noticed where he’d rather pay $200 for a flight with free internet and food than $150 for a flight where you have to pay $10 each for internet and food.  It’s a bias that sounds really weird when I say it, but that I totally fall for in real life and would be worth exploring further.  I think it’s a matter of how people construct “mental buckets” for spending, and $200 is totally reasonable for your “flight” bucket the same way $150 is, but $10 is not reasonable for your “food” bucket.  Same reason why people will travel several miles to save $10 on gasoline, but not travel several miles to save $10 on a car.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, here are <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/09/9-ways-marketing-weasels-will-try-to-manipulate-you.html">“Nine Ways Marketing Weasels Will Try to Manipulate You”</a>, based on biases like that.  Pricing bias is the most scary.  But watch out for the mentions that “rationality can be cold, unemotional, and bad” (<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/90n/summary_of_the_straw_vulcan/">straw vulcanism</a>) at the bottom of the essay.

    <p>This website is about things that have worked <em>for me</em>.  The “for me” part is key.  This website isn’t about giving you advice, as much as I want other people to share in my lifestyle choices.  Why?  Well, first, I’m not nearly experienced enough to offer you advice.  But second, <strong>the advice probably won’t work.</strong></p>

<p>I have a theory, which <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/9v/beware_of_otheroptimizing/">Eliezer Yudkowsky also discovered</a>, that many people will hunt through the web looking for tips on something: how to run, how to make a to-do list, etc., that optimize some part of their life.  They’ll consider, say, five or six different approaches, and then they’ll finally find the one <em>that works</em>.  And this is a magical moment that must be shared with everyone, because your dedication has unveiled the one method <em>that works</em>, and you can save everyone the time of trying the five other approaches that <em>don’t work</em>.</p>

<p>…Except you missed a step. You forgot to take into account that while people are rather similar, there’s enough individual differences in what people prefer, what makes people comfortable, how people think about things, etc., that what works for you <em>might not work for other people</em>.  Indeed, all six of the approaches you consider probably have each worked for <em>someone</em> at one point or another, <em>or they wouldn’t have been written about in the first place</em>.  No one, I hope, writes about failed self-improvement methods, unless… well… it’s about how those methods have failed.

    <p>One hundred twenty-six days ago, I was overweight.  I was 6’1” and 220lbs. I needed to do something, so I turned to was exercise.  I started out trying to run.  I could barely run half a mile before I got winded and had to stop.  I couldn’t keep going.  Now, 126 days later, I have run my first 5k.  I didn’t do an official 5k or anything.  I just ran the 5k distance (3.1 miles) – run away from my house, go 1.55 miles down the street, turn around, and run 1.55 miles back.</p>

<p>I had never run a 5k before.  I had once been very close.  I got all the way to 2.7 miles.  But then I got injured for a week, sick for another week, and didn’t run for almost all of March.  I tried running again after that, but I got tired after running just a mile, and I stopped.  Eventually, after a bit more practice I worked my way back to being able to run 1.5 miles, but it still wasn’t going well.  I was a long way away from being able to break the 5k barrier.
