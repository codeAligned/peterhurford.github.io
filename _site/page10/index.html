  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There seems to be many important questions that need research, from the mundane (say, which of four slogans for 80,000 Hours people like best) to the interesting (say, how to convince people to donate more than they otherwise would).  Unfortunately, it’s difficult to collect data in a quick, reliable, and affordable way.  We generally lack access to easily survey-able populations and a lot of research has high barriers to entry for completing (such as needing to enroll in graduate school).</p>

<p>However, since the 2005 creation of <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon’s Mechanical Turk</a>, some of this has changed.  Mechanical Turk is a website where anyone can create tasks for people to complete at a certain wage.  These tasks can be anything, from identifying pictures to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-reliability-efficiencyaffordability-of-amazons-mechanical-turk/22994">transcribing interviews</a> to social science research.</p>

<p>Best of all, this is quick and cheap – for example, you could offer $0.25 to complete a short survey, put $75 in a pot, and get 300 responses within a day or two, and this should be quicker and cheaper than any other option available to you for collecting data.</p>

<p>But could Mechanical Turk actually be useable for answering important questions?  Could running studies on Mechanical Turk be a competitive use of altruistic funds?

    <p><em>Continuation of <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/i-now-have-approximately-five-career-categories/">“I Now Have Approximately Five Career Categories”</a>.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/i-now-have-approximately-five-career-categories/">Earlier</a>, I outlined approximately five things I’d consider as my post-college career: grad school, law school, market research, computer programming, and working directly for an effective altruist organization.</p>

<p>But which one should I pick?  I don’t actually know yet.  In the end, I can only pick one of the five to start with (though I probably could switch easily if I needed to.)  So I thought I would attempt to compare these careers across a few different categories, see what happens, and then outline some questions I still have and my next steps.

    <p><em>Continued from <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-plan/">“My Careers Plan”</a>.</em></p>

<p>As I continue the third week of the school year, I have 7 months and 29 days until I graduate and need a “Thing To Do After I Graduate”(TM) in order to qualify for “The Real World”(TM).  Earlier, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-plan/">I outlined a plan</a> to try and get a career that would lead me on a path “that will, taken as a whole, contribute the most to the world with regard to my utilitarian goals to increase total well-being”.</p>

<p>I recognize that my first career very likely won’t be my only career or even the place I spent all that much time at.  But it’s important that I have a “first step” or “five year plan” to figure out where I’m supposed to be pointed at in order to make this well-being maximization thing actually happen.</p>

<p>So where should I point?  I’ve narrowed it down to approximately five broad categories.  In no particular order, they are: law school, graduate school, computer programming, market research, or non-profit work.  I say “approximately” because these categories can be combined in some ways to make new opportunities.</p>

<p>Here’s the details.  Sorry it’s long, but it’s a complicated question and I have a lot of thoughts.  I really appreciate all those people who have taken the time to slog through this with me and give me valuable advice.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Why do people give to charity?</p>

<p>It seems strange to even ask. Most people would point to the fact that they’re altruistic and want to make a difference. Others are concerned with inequality and justice. Another group points to the concept of “paying it forward” or repaying a debt to society. Other explanations cite various religious or social reasons.</p>

<p>Not too many people cite the fact that giving makes them happier. Even if people agree this is true, I don’t often hear it as people’s main reason. Instead, it’s more like a beneficial side effect. In fact, it seems pretty odd to me to hear someone boldly proclaim that they give only because it makes them happier, even if it might be true.</p>

<p>But if it’s true that giving does make people happier, should we be promoting that publicly and loudly? Perhaps it might make a great opportunity to tap into groups who wouldn’t consider giving otherwise or have misconceptions that giving would make them miserable? I’m a bit worried about how it might affect people’s incentives.</p>

<p>In this essay, I follow the evidence provided in the Harvard Business School working paper <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6272.html">“Feeling Good About Giving: The Benefits (and Costs) of Self-Interested Charitable Behavior”</a> by Lalin Anik, Lara B. Aknin, Michael I. Norton, and Elizabeth W. Dunn. Overall, in light of potential incentive effects, I think caution and further investigation is warranted when promoting the happiness side of giving.

The minimum wage actually (1) doesn’t cover everyone, (2) doesn’t stay the same unless Congress changes it, (3) obviously increase unemployment when raised, (4) or help the working poor when raised. It also (5) isn’t a partisan issue.</p>

<p>Need more myths?  Ok.  Here’s <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5895140/10-stubborn-exercise-myths-that-wont-die-debunked-by-science">10 Stubborn Exercise Myths That Won’t Die</a>.  Turns out things like “No Pain, No Gain” is false, soreness after exercise isn’t caused by lactic acid building up in muscles, exercise doesn’t have to take long hours and isn’t worthless if you don’t do it regularly, you don’t need a sports drink or supplements, you actually shouldn’t stretch, you will lose weight but you won’t lose weight quickly.  Furthermore, exercising when you’re old is still fine even if you didn’t do it when young, and working out in your home isn’t better or worse than working out at the gym.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/03/if-you-pay-them-money-partisans-will-tell-you-the-truth/">If you pay them money, partisans will tell you the truth</a>.  There has been a surprising finding that political partisans don’t just disagree on the issues, but also basic facts like the level of unemployment.  However, this theory suggests that they don’t actually disagree, they’re just essentially lying to show support for their preferred side.  If you offer them money to give a correct answer, this partisan effect disappears.  …At least in one study.</p>

<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gz/policy_debates_should_not_appear_onesided/">“Policy Debates Should Not Appear One-Sided”</a>: “Arguments are soldiers.  Once you know which side you’re on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it’s like stabbing your soldiers in the back.  If you abide within that pattern, policy debates will also appear one-sided to you—the costs and drawbacks of your favored policy are enemy soldiers, to be attacked by any means necessary.”</p>

<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/6py/optimal_philanthropy_for_human_beings/">“Optimal Philanthropy for Human Beings”</a>: “The psychology of charitable giving offers three pieces of advice to those who want to give charity and those who want to receive it: Enjoy the happiness that giving brings, commit future income, and realize that requesting time increases the odds of getting money.”</p>
