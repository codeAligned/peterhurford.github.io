  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>My time that I have available to blog has seen a noted decrease since I started college again and, honestly, my interest in blogging has waned a little bit.  So I think it’s best that I take a one week blog break and focus on my other tasks.</p>

<p><strong>I should be back to posting here on</strong> 16 September <strong>18 September.</strong>  Talk to you then.</p>

    <p>Why do people give to charity?</p>

<p>It seems strange to even ask. Most people would point to the fact that they’re altruistic and want to make a difference. Others are concerned with inequality and justice. Another group points to the concept of “paying it forward” or repaying a debt to society. Other explanations cite various religious or social reasons.</p>

<p>Not too many people cite the fact that giving makes them happier. Even if people agree this is true, I don’t often hear it as people’s main reason. Instead, it’s more like a beneficial side effect. In fact, it seems pretty odd to me to hear someone boldly proclaim that they give only because it makes them happier, even if it might be true.</p>

<p>But if it’s true that giving does make people happier, should we be promoting that publicly and loudly? Perhaps it might make a great opportunity to tap into groups who wouldn’t consider giving otherwise or have misconceptions that giving would make them miserable? I’m a bit worried about how it might affect people’s incentives.</p>

<p>In this essay, I follow the evidence provided in the Harvard Business School working paper <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6272.html">“Feeling Good About Giving: The Benefits (and Costs) of Self-Interested Charitable Behavior”</a> by Lalin Anik, Lara B. Aknin, Michael I. Norton, and Elizabeth W. Dunn. Overall, in light of potential incentive effects, I think caution and further investigation is warranted when promoting the happiness side of giving.

The minimum wage actually (1) doesn’t cover everyone, (2) doesn’t stay the same unless Congress changes it, (3) obviously increase unemployment when raised, (4) or help the working poor when raised. It also (5) isn’t a partisan issue.</p>

<p>Need more myths?  Ok.  Here’s <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5895140/10-stubborn-exercise-myths-that-wont-die-debunked-by-science">10 Stubborn Exercise Myths That Won’t Die</a>.  Turns out things like “No Pain, No Gain” is false, soreness after exercise isn’t caused by lactic acid building up in muscles, exercise doesn’t have to take long hours and isn’t worthless if you don’t do it regularly, you don’t need a sports drink or supplements, you actually shouldn’t stretch, you will lose weight but you won’t lose weight quickly.  Furthermore, exercising when you’re old is still fine even if you didn’t do it when young, and working out in your home isn’t better or worse than working out at the gym.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/03/if-you-pay-them-money-partisans-will-tell-you-the-truth/">If you pay them money, partisans will tell you the truth</a>.  There has been a surprising finding that political partisans don’t just disagree on the issues, but also basic facts like the level of unemployment.  However, this theory suggests that they don’t actually disagree, they’re just essentially lying to show support for their preferred side.  If you offer them money to give a correct answer, this partisan effect disappears.  …At least in one study.</p>

<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gz/policy_debates_should_not_appear_onesided/">“Policy Debates Should Not Appear One-Sided”</a>: “Arguments are soldiers.  Once you know which side you’re on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it’s like stabbing your soldiers in the back.  If you abide within that pattern, policy debates will also appear one-sided to you—the costs and drawbacks of your favored policy are enemy soldiers, to be attacked by any means necessary.”</p>

<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/6py/optimal_philanthropy_for_human_beings/">“Optimal Philanthropy for Human Beings”</a>: “The psychology of charitable giving offers three pieces of advice to those who want to give charity and those who want to receive it: Enjoy the happiness that giving brings, commit future income, and realize that requesting time increases the odds of getting money.”</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I’m interested in an idea called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">effective altruism”</a> which is about not just doing things to make the world a better place, but about thinking about what can do to make their helping go the <em>furthest</em>.  For example, if I could spend an hour and help a person cross the street that would be cool, but if I could spend an hour and cure blindness in three different people, that would be <em>even cooler</em>.</p>

<p>Generally, it seems like people either immediately get “effective altruism” or they don’t.  Evidence from <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> member surveys plus other anecdotal evidence seems to support this. But as the “effective altruism” movement is going to grows, we’ll eventually run out of those who find the idea intuitive and we’ll need to start pitching to people who find the idea unintuitive.  How do we do this?
