    <p><strong>Continuation of <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">How Much Does It Cost to Buy a Vegetarian</a></strong></p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been trying to figure out how much it costs to save animals from factory farming.  The idea is to get people to become vegetarian by funding advertisements to influence them.  In <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">the previous essay</a>, I used a simple formula to work out the cost and it turned out to be a really cheap $0.02 to prevent a year of animal suffering on a factory farm (about $10 to get someone to become vegetarian for a year).</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/">built a calculator</a> so that anyone can play around with the formulas and be as pessimistic or optimistic as they like and see how that effects the calculations.</p>

<p>However, the simple calculation is… well… <em>simple</em>, and it needs some “beefing up”, no pun intended.  Therefore, I also built a “complex calculator” that works on a much more complex formula[1] that is hopefully correct[2] and will provide a more accurate estimation.  Here are the details…

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I start with the claim that it’s good for people to eat less meat, whether they become vegetarian – or, better yet, vegan – because this means less nonhuman animals are being <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/whyvegan/animals.html">painfully factory farmed</a>.  I’ve defended this claim previously in <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-eat-less-meat/">“Why Eat Less Meat?”</a>.</p>

<p>The second idea is that it shouldn’t matter <em>who</em> is eating less meat.  As long as less meat is being eaten, less animals will be farmed, and this is a good thing.  Therefore, we should try to get <em>other people</em> to also try and eat less meat.</p>

<p>The third idea is that it also doesn’t matter <em>who</em> is doing the convincing.  Therefore, instead of convincing our own friends and family, we can pay other people to convince people to eat less meat.  And this is exactly what organizations like <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/">Vegan Outreach</a> and <a href="http://www.thehumaneleague.com/">The Humane League</a> are doing.  With a certain amount of money, one can hire someone to distribute pamphlets to other people or put advertisements on the internet, and some percentage of people who receive the pamphlets or see the ads will go on to eat less meat.</p>

<p>But the fourth idea is the complication.  I want my philanthropic dollars to go as far as possible, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">so as to help as much as possible</a>.  Therefore, it becomes very important to try and figure out how much money it takes to get people to eat less meat, so I can compare this to other estimations and see what gets me the best “bang for my buck”.

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Welcome to the fourth edition of Sunday Links!</p>

<p>In this edition, I’m going to focus on the exploration of “earning to give”.  You know how some people talk about “doing well by doing good”?  Well “earning to give” is basically “doing good by doing well” – you look specifically for a high paying job in order to earn a lot of money, and then use your large disposable income to donate to charity.</p>

<p>For instance, one might think to join a non-profit and do important work and earn a salary of $30K.  Or, one might instead choose to become a banker or stock trader, earn $100K+, keep the same salary of $30K, and and donate the $70K+ and hire <em>two or more</em> charity workers to serve in their place.  Chances are good that those two charity workers who displace you will do more good combined than you will have done if you worked in their place, and that you displaced someone who would have joined finance but not donated their money.</p>

<p>As Jeff Kaufman <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-03-11">considers summarizing it</a>, the idea is to “[g]ive money to the most effective charities, and maximize your impact by earning more and spending less.””  A basic introduction of this idea can be found in the <a href="http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give">80000 Hours topic</a> and <a href="http://80000hours.org/faq#faq-what-is-earning-to-give">corresponding FAQ</a>.  Brian Tomasik also has a pretty thorough summary of the idea in <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html">“Why Activists Should Consider Making Lots of Money”</a>.</p>

<h2 id="popular-press-objections-and-rebuttals">Popular Press, Objections, and Rebuttals</h2>

<p>This idea has taken to popular press over the years, with <a href="http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2011/11/banking-as-an-ethical-career/">an article on Practical Ethics</a>, <a href="http://qz.com/57254/to-save-the-world-dont-get-a-job-at-a-charity-go-work-on-wall-street/">Quartz</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15820786">BBC</a>, and recently <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/?tid=ts_carousel">The Washington Post</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2334682/Young-professionals-joining-Wall-Street-save-world.html">Daily Mail</a>.</p>

<p>The Washington Post article in particular prompted people to write in some criticism, including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?_r=1">a column from David Brooks</a>.  Brooks argues that (1) you risk losing your motivation and (2) you risk not living a sufficiently “full” life.  Alexander Berger <a href="http://marginalchange.blogspot.ca/2013/06/2013-david-brooks-vs-2011-david-brooks.html">responds</a>, pointing out that burnout is a risk, but the motivations of those people earning to give are definitely there and that they are living “full” lives.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/349841/rise-singerians-reihan-salam">objection in the National Review</a> that suggests “earning to give” favors individual action and ignores the good that can come from public action.  This is <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage">responded to by 80,000 Hours</a>, which says it’s a political point being read that doesn’t actually exist.</p>

<p>Ben Kuhn <a href="http://www.benkuhn.net/etg-objections">looks at more objections</a> that surfaced in the comments sections of various articles, and he finds that people object to (1) some “earning to give” careers (like banking) doing bad by promoting negative capitalist systems, (2) that where “earning to give” people are giving (mostly the <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com">Against Malaria Foundation</a> ignores focusing on “root causes” in favor of addressing symptoms, and (3) general objections to utilitarianism.  Kuhn addresses those arguments in that article.</p>

<p>Jeff Kaufman also looks at objections to banking as a career and <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-06-03">proposes we talk about other careers instead</a>, like computer programming, teacher, or social worker.  Julia Wise writes about <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/whats-it-like-to-give-half.html">how she could still “earn to give” on a $38K salary</a>.</p>

<h2 id="but-is-earning-to-give-actually-a-good-idea">But is “Earning to Give” Actually a Good Idea?</h2>

<p>So all this is great, and I’m glad there’s a big conversation now on effectiveness and considering career choice as an ethical question.  However, while the level of criticism I’ve seen in the popular press isn’t great, there definitely are objections to “earning to give” that matter.</p>

<p><strong>First, I think the issue of burnout is considered by those who think about “earning to give”, but never directly addressed.</strong>  How many people pursuing “earning to give” end up burning out?   And what happens then?  Can one really choose <em>any</em> high-earning career and do well at it, or does one also need some sort of direct passion for the job?</p>

<p><strong>Second, can’t there be more beneficial careers than “earning to give”?</strong> Generally, I agree with <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage">80,000 Hours’s response</a> and <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-03-02">Jeff Kaufman’s consideration</a> that “earning to give” is a <em>baseline</em>, not the best option.  It’s a useful and powerful point of comparison to ask “Is what I’m doing better than just earning a higher salary and donating it?”.</p>

<p>Frequently, however, I think this baseline can be beaten.  While there’s a “make more money to donate” side of things, there’s also a “make the donated money work better” side, working in the organizations themselves to increase the impact of each donation by increasing the impact of the organizations themselves.  As Jeff Kaufman records in <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-05-20">“Talent or Money”</a>, some organizations like <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> probably would benefit more from additional talent than additional money.  In <a href="http://www.effective-altruism.com/node/31">“Earning to Give vs. Altruistic Career Choice Revisited”</a>, Jonah Sinick discusses that consideration among a few others.</p>

<p>Overall, the career you choose is an incredibly important choice to consider not just from a personal perspective, but from an ethical perspective.  But it’s also a very individual choice and the good one can do with their career and the satisfaction they can get out of it depend immensely on one’s individual talents and desires.  Therefore, a would-be career do-gooder should instead try to find individualized advice (such as that offered by <a href="http://www.80000hours.org">80000 Hours</a>) and consider a wider variety of careers.</p>

    <p>In Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em>, Odysseus’s crew sailed past the island of the Sirens. In Greek lore, the Sirens were notorious for singing a song so enchanting that those who listened would sail toward the Sirens and end up crashing into the rocks, sealing their own fate.</p>

<p>The common solution of the era was to avoid listening to the song altogether – plugging one’s ears with beeswax. But Odysseus wanted to listen to the song… though, of course, he didn’t want to end up crashing his ship and killing his crew.</p>

<p>Thus, not trusting his future willpower, Odysseus had his crew tie him to the mast of the ship and precommitted to not be let go. Predictably, when he heard the song he begged to be released, but his crew followed his earlier orders and didn’t let him go. Odysseus survived on the basis of precommitment1.

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>For the past two years, the only place I ate meat was at home with my family.  As of October 2012, I’ve finally stopped eating meat altogether and can’t see a reason why I would want to go back to eating meat.  This kind of attitude toward eating is commonly classified as “vegetarianism” where one refrains from eating the flesh of all animals, including fish, but still will consume animal products like eggs and milk (though I try to avoid egg as best I can).</p>

<p>Why might I want to do this?  And why might I see it as a serious issue?  It’s because I’m very concerned about the reality of suffering done to our “food animals” in the process of making them into meat, because I see vegetarianism as a way to reduce this suffering by stopping the harmful process, and because vegetarianism has not been hard at all for me to accomplish.
