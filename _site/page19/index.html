Presumably, if the person is guilty, and they have some sort of evidence of their own guilt, than shouldn’t they ought to be compelled to provide that evidence, given that it helps put punish a guilty person?  The problems, then, are really in the nature of the coercion and whether this coercion would negatively effect innocent people enough as to be worth it.  But that seems better stopped by outlawing “cruel and unusual tactics” and regulating interrogation better.  To be clear, I’m not saying I don’t like the “right to remain silent”, just that I can’t currently make sense of it.</p>

    <p><strong>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/giving-now-currently-seems-to-beat-giving-later/">Giving Now Currently Seems To Beat Giving Later</a></strong></p>

<p>Thinking about <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">analyzing cost-effectiveness for vegetarian outreach</a>, has made me think more about where philanthropic dollars should go in order to do the most amount of good.  Most people just give to whatever charities come their way, send them advertisements, etc.  A lot of people are also concerned with giving back to their local community, supporting their church, or their university.</p>

<p>I don’t condemn any of those motivations – I think they’re wonderful, local communities do deserve support, and there’s something to be said for “paying it forward” and giving back to those who have set you up for success.  But I’m mostly concerned with what one should do with the goal to <a href="">improve the world as much as possible</a> (on the assumption that all interests count equally), and I’ve changed the way I think.

    <p>Among those people interested in doing as much as they can to make the world a better place and think donating their money as effectively as possible is a good way to do that, there is a debate about whether one should either (a) donate a specific portion of one’s income in small installments each year or (b) invest one’s income and then donate as much as possible in one large lump sum right before death.  Of course, there are other positions – like donate every month or donate every decade, but in a very relevant sense the debate is between two options: “give now” vs. “give later”.</p>

<p>In this essay, I will defend the “give now” camp and rebut the “give later” camp, thus explaining why I will continue to donate once a year, though think any sort of regular time period smaller than each year is probably also acceptable.

    <p><strong>Continuation of <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/buying-vegetarians-handling-complications/">Buying Vegetarians: Handling Complications</a></strong></p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been trying to figure out how much it costs to save animals from factory farming. The idea is to get people to become vegetarian by funding advertisements to influence them.  Previously <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">I did a simple calculation</a> and came up with two cents to avert a year of suffering in a factory farm.  Then <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/buying-vegetarians-handling-complications/">I did a more complex calculation</a> and came up with a range between two cents to $65.92 to avert a year of suffering.</p>

<p>Many people are skeptical of these figures.  Perhaps surprisingly, so am I.  I’m trying to strike a balance between being an advocate of vegan outreach as a very promising path for making the world a better place, while not losing sight of the methodological hurdles that have not yet been met, and open to the possibility that I’m <em>wrong about this</em>.</p>

<p>In this essay, I’m going to discuss those hurdles.

<p>Recently, I’ve been trying to figure out how much it costs to save animals from factory farming.  The idea is to get people to become vegetarian by funding advertisements to influence them.  In <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">the previous essay</a>, I used a simple formula to work out the cost and it turned out to be a really cheap $0.02 to prevent a year of animal suffering on a factory farm (about $10 to get someone to become vegetarian for a year).</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/">built a calculator</a> so that anyone can play around with the formulas and be as pessimistic or optimistic as they like and see how that effects the calculations.</p>

<p>However, the simple calculation is… well… <em>simple</em>, and it needs some “beefing up”, no pun intended.  Therefore, I also built a “complex calculator” that works on a much more complex formula[1] that is hopefully correct[2] and will provide a more accurate estimation.  Here are the details…
