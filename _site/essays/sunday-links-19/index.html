The real question is <a href="http://whywereason.com/2011/07/29/why-youll-pay-for-silence-john-cages-433/">why would people buy it?</a>.  The answer is a tale of how we don't value things solely for what they do, but also for their history.

<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/5r6/spend_money_on_ergonomics/">It seems like it could be more worthwhile than commonly thought to spend money on improving one's ergonomics</a>.  And while we're on the topic of applied rationality, here's <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/7am/rational_home_buying/">better house buying through knowledge of heuristics and biases</a>.

<a href="www.cookingfor20.com/2013/06/18/hacker-school-soylent-recipe/">Soylent</a> is an artifical mixture of nutrients that supplies everything you need in a diet without actually requiring food.  <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/06/10/soylent-is-the-food-of-the-future-really-a-nutrition-solution/">Here's a good review from TIME</a>.

<a href="http://www.academia.edu/1093050/The_Paradox_of_Deontology_Revisited">The paradox of deontology</a>: If a certain thing is bad according to deontology, why is it not ok to do that bad thing in order to cause even more cases of that bad thing from happening?

<a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30937/famous-novelists-symbolism-their-work-and-whether-it-was-intentional">Turns out that much symbolism in many famous novels wasn't intentional.</a>  Also, novelists can be a bit rude when responding to surveys.
