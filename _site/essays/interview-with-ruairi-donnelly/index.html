      <p><img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/to-peter-300x198.jpeg" alt="to peter" />Some people have committed a great deal of their lives to trying to best make the world a better place.  I’m trying to sit down with some of these people and learn more about their thoughts and motivations.</p>

<p>Today, I sit down with <strong>Ruairí Donnelly</strong>, a recent high school graduate and dedicated “effective altruist” and utilitarian, to see what he has to say.  Ruairí writes a blog called <a href="http://www.ruairidonnelly.com/">“Ruairí Loves”</a> which details “adventures in ethics, utilitarianism, antispeciesim, effective altruism, and veganism”.<!-- more --></p>

<p><em><strong>Peter Hurford:</strong> I know a fair amount of utilitarians, and they’re usually pretty young, like in their 20s or 30s.  But you’re just out of high school, and were an active contributor to effective altruist and utilitarian hangouts while still in high school.  How did you get involved at such a young age?</em></p>

<p><strong>Ruairí Donnelly:</strong> In 2011, I thought that I should probably start deciding what I wanted to do with my life. I had always wanted to be a hero and I decided that the best way to do this was to prevent the most suffering I could and make the most happiness I could. I googled this and found that there was a word for this already, “Utilitarianism”. I found <a href="http://www.felicifia.org">Felicifia</a>, a utilitarian forum where I was able to learn from a bunch of brilliant people and ask loads of annoying questions. “Effective altruism” was coined some time later and some of the people from Felicifia were involved in this, this is how I found effective altruism.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> When most people I know think of heroes, they think of firefighters or police officers or Jack Bauer stopping terrorists.  I don’t know any that think of utilitarianism.  Why do you think that good heroes are utilitarians?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> Well I certainly don’t want to imply that these people aren’t heroes. But sometimes I think we can get a little mixed up in our thinking about heroism. A hero is someone who strives to do a huge amount of good.  This doesn’t necessarily imply rescuing people or being in dangerous situations at all, but this seems to be the kind of things we associate with heroes.</p>

<p>Before I discovered utilitarianism and effective altruism, I wanted to work in mountain rescue, but when I realized how much good I could do by working in other areas I changed my plans. So I think it’s important for us not to mix up different ideas, a hero is someone who strives to do a lot of good and this is exactly what utilitarians also strive to do.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong>  What are you working on now that you’re out of high school?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> For the next year I’ll be working on a bunch of different projects, mostly with a new group called “Animal Ethics”, but also on some other effective altruist projects and on my future career plans.</p>

<p>Animal Ethics will work to spread anti-speciesism and prevent suffering, one area we are particularly interested in is the case of <a href="http://vimeo.com/58451841">suffering in the wild</a>. Helping wild animals is part of an anti-speciesist position and we hope to encourage people to think more about this important issue. It seems that movement building, values spreading and fundraising are currently three of the most effective activities for altruistic groups. Animal Ethics will be very involved in all of these.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> How did you get involved in worrying about wild animal suffering?  The idea of focusing on this cause is pretty out there, even among utilitarians, and there’s a strong perception that either the wild isn’t really “all that bad” or that there’s not much that can be done to help wild animals.</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong>  I don’t think caring about wild animals is that unusual, especially among anti-speciesists, as it is part of their position. Many people seem to notice the many harms that happen to wild animals and the ways in which we can help them. Due to r-selection, the reproductive strategy of having a huge number of children, almost all of which then soon die, massive amounts of suffering occur in the wild. R-selection is the most common reproductive strategy in nature and if an animal population is remaining stable only one animal per parent will survive, all the rest will die. This entails suffering for astronomical numbers of animals as <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/number-of-wild-animals.html">the number of wild animals is simply enormous</a>. It’s true to say that the majority of the suffering in the world occurs in the wild.</p>

<p>It’s certainly not true that there isn’t much that can be done to help wild animals, already there have been many successful programs which have helped wild animals by using things such as vaccines. In the future when humanity has created more powerful technology it may be possible to aid wild animals in really awesome ways, but I’m sure that this will only happen if we build the foundations now, that is, it is vital that we show people that they are doing the right thing when they reduce the amount of suffering that occurs in nature.</p>

<p>Regarding the conditions of the lives of wild animals I would urge people to read the essays and papers written by Brian Tomasik and Oscar Horta, two of the most well known authorities in the world on this issue.  I’d suggest <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html">“The Importance of Wild Animal Suffering”</a>, <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/intervene-in-nature.html">“Should We Intervene in Nature”</a>, and <a href="http://academia.edu/2290959/Debunking_the_Idyllic_View_of_Natural_Processes_Population_Dynamics_and_Suffering_in_the_Wild">“Debunking the Idyllic View of Natural Processes: Population Dynamics and Suffering in the Wild”</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> I also see you’re also thinking a lot about long-term career choice, what are your current thoughts?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> I might <a href="http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give">“Earn to Give”</a> (perhaps by studying computer science in university and then finding a well paid job), or maybe do direct work such as fundraising and movement building. At the moment I’m leaning more towards direct work, but there’s a never ending amount of stuff I want to learn about before I decide, so maybe I’ll change my mind.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> When I think fundraising, I think those annoying people on the street that want me to donate to their political advocacy groups.  Surely that’s not what you’re thinking?  Could you elaborate on the opportunities in fundraising?  Why would you be interested in that?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> The kind of fundraising you describe, street fundraising, was the first kind of fundraising I looked into. But as I talk to people more I get the impression that it seems like “major donor fundraising” might be more effective still. Unfortunately I haven’t had much time to research fundraising lately, but I hope to in the future.</p>

<p>Fundraising often has a bad reputation, but I don’t think that this should necessarily be the case. Suppose we’re fundraising for a very effective cause, by doing so it’s possible to multiply the amount of resources at our disposal and thereby do much more good. Fundraising also raises awareness for a cause, so it’s possible to fundraise and build your movement at the same time. You can read the post I <a href="http://www.ruairidonnelly.com/?p=37">originally wrote about fundraising</a>.</p>

<p>However, there are some problems with fundraising, if people donate to your charity instead of a similar one then you’re not creating any “new” donations. However, <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising">more fundraising does create more “new” donors</a>, just maybe not as many as we might have first thought; and by fundraising for a highly effective cause the damage of “taking” money from another cause is reduced.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> How did you get involved with Animal Ethics?  What should someone who wants to get involved with preventing wild animal suffering do?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> I had been doing activism involving spreading the ideas of anti-speciesism and reducing wild animal suffering for a while, during which I had made contact with some people who were involved in setting up Animal Ethics.  The more I realised it was a very high impact cause, the more involved I became.  Probably the best thing for someone who is interested in these issues to do is to contact me! My email address is ruairi.donnelly94@gmail.com.  You also could read Brian’s <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/wild-animal-volunteering.html">“Ideas for Volunteering to Reduce Wild-Animal Suffering”</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> How did you end up meeting those people?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> Through <a href="http://www.felicifia.org">Felicifia</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/">Facebook</a>, and other places where effective altruists gather together.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> In addition to wild animal suffering, you’re also interested in preventing what you call “future suffering”.  What is future suffering and how should we go about preventing it?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> When people talk about “future suffering” they are usually referring to the unfortunate possibility of large amounts of suffering occurring reasonably far into the future. A lot of these scenarios may initially sound unlikely, and I think that a lot of them are, but given how much is at stake I think some of them are important issues that we should consider carefully. Some common scenarios include:</p>

<p><strong>“Suffering subroutines”</strong>, that is, basically the creation of sentient processes in computers which may suffer, they might be used for reinforcement learning or something similar. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0KTUysrwgQ">This video</a> is a visceral example of something similar to this, but in it seems likely that in reality sentient machines might not be made to look similar to us at all.</p>

<p><strong>Sentient simulations.</strong> A similar scenario in which humans manage to create sentient simulations of suffering individuals. Imagine “The Sims”, except for real… This is also worrying from the point of view of sentient wild animals being simulated, given <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html">how much it seems wild animals suffer</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Spreading suffering wildlife</strong> to other planets.</p>

<p>A future controlled by <strong><a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html">darwinian forces</a></strong>.</p>

<p>The creation of <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/lab-universes.html"><strong>lab universes</strong></a> which contain a lot of suffering.</p>

<p><strong>Much of the current status quo continues</strong>, non-human animals continue suffering horrifically in factory farms, third world poverty and hunger continue, other sources of suffering continue.</p>

<p>As I said, I think a lot of these are probably quite unlikely, however, perhaps the one I find most worrying, and quite likely too, is that the future will be largely controlled by some unknown unknown factor that we haven’t thought of, sometimes called “Black Swans”. The number of future scenarios that get discussed among effective altruists often seem to be very narrow and very inline with the values of those effective altruists. In reality I think we are probably not considering the vast, vast majority of possible futures, and given current human values I think the chance of these futures scenarios containing a lot of suffering is quite high.</p>

<p>People interested in these issues should check out <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=537">this thread</a> and <a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/09/btomasi1/">contact Brian Tomasik</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> Suffering subroutines?  Why should we care about computers?  Do you think they feel pain?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> It seems very unlikely that computers currently feel pain, but in the future perhaps humanity will create sentient computers. Already there are efforts to create a <a href="http://www.artificialbrains.com/openworm">simulation of a nematode worm</a> and, on a much more ambitious scale, a <a href="http://io9.com/5980117/new-16-billion-supercomputer-project-will-attempt-to-simulate-the-human-brain">simulation of the human brain</a>.</p>

<p>If sentient computers were created we should definitely care about them. The criteria that distinguishes whether or not we should care about something morally is whether or not it is sentient, whether or not it can feel. That’s why we care about sentient things like people and dogs, but not about non-sentient things.</p>

<p>Luckily some people have started talking about these possibilities and it looks like there will be a lot of exciting work done in this area in the future. Thomas Metzinger, a German philosopher, asks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would you say if someone came along and said, “Hey, we want to genetically engineer mentally retarded human infants! For reasons of scientific progress we need infants with certain cognitive and emotional deficits in order to study their postnatal psychological development — we urgently need some funding for this important and innovative kind of research!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You would certainly think this was not only an absurd and appalling but also a dangerous idea. It would hopefully not pass any ethics committee in the democratic world.</p>

<p>However, what today’s ethics committees don’t see is how the first machines satisfying a minimally sufficient set of constraints for conscious experience could be just like such mentally retarded infants. They would suffer from all kinds of functional and representational deficits too. But they would now also subjectively experience those deficits. In addition, they would have no political lobby — no representatives in any ethics committee.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> Another comment I’d like to note is that all these scenarios do seem rather unlikely.  Yet you’re preparing for them anyway.  I feel like anyone involved in existential risk does the same – trying to make an unlikely event even more unlikely.  But why bother, if it’s probably not going to happen?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> Some of these scenarios could potentially cause astronomical amounts of suffering to occur, even if we can only change the probability of these scenarios happening slightly, it’s still very important. The future also seems likely to contain many more sentient beings than we can currently aid at the moment, due to the fact that the future stretches out for a very long time in front of us.</p>

<p>However, I do think that some of these scenarios are quite unlikely and also that in general people may only consider a very narrow set of possible futures. Therefore I think it may be a better idea to simply promote values such as anti-speciesism and utilitarianism. Then these values will influence whatever future comes to happen.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> A lot of utilitarians I know like to think really far in the future.  But how do you think we can shape the future?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> I think spreading our values might be one of the one of the best ways to improve what the future is likely to be like. Maybe without a handful of utilitarian philosophers who spread their values in the past the entire effective altruist movement would not exist! There are other ways too, such as improving the chance of “in-vitro meat” becoming commercially viable or how quickly it becomes commercially viable. </p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> Where do you think the “effective altruist” movement is going?  How do you plan to help build it?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> I’m hopeful that more people in the effective altruist movement will consider the harms that non-human animals suffer more seriously. 58 billion land animals are killed for human consumption each year, most of these endure horrific lives, and the lower estimate for the number of marine animals killed by humans <a href="http://fishcount.org.uk/fish-welfare-in-commercial-fishing/estimate-of-fish-numbers">is one trillion</a>; the actual number may be much higher.</p>

<p>To be an effective altruist one must take this suffering very seriously. I hope to encourage effective altruists to think more about this suffering, and I hope to build the movement in general. Movement building seems to be a very effective activity due to the fact that the new activists you inspire can go on to inspire more people, I hope to focus on it this year and in the future.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> What is your typical day like right now?  What do you do, if anything, in terms of diet and exercise?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> I don’t currently have any specific exercise plan, while I was studying I used to take very brief breaks and do body weight exercises every 40 minutes. As well as the benefits of exercise it was useful to take a break from my study. I might continue with this or come up a new plan depending on how long I seem to be able to work without needing a break. As for diet I am vegan. Lately I haven’t been eating as healthily as I should, so that’s something I will have to change!</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> How did you become a vegan?  Was it easy?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> I had a conversation with some very effective vegan activists in which I realised that becoming vegan was definitely the right thing to do. I found it quite easy, I think in general people imagine that it will be much more difficult than it really is. And of course the amount of suffering that one prevents by being vegan is absolutely huge in comparison to the occasional inconvenience.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> Do you attempt to convince others to go vegan?  What convincing strategies do you find effective?  What worked on you?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> I think it’s important for vegan activists to know their facts and always remain calm. The idea of the “crazy vegan” activist is very common at the moment, I think we definitely need to combat this but at the same time should certainly discuss these issues and try our best to convince people. It’s important to remember that we should pursue whatever strategy will prevent as much suffering as possible, being seen as crazy is probably not how to do this. It may be frustrating that people may not seem to care about causing suffering but being seen as crazy isn’t going to change their minds.</p>

<p>In terms of organizations I think it is absolutely vital that charities measure their impact and constantly try to improve it. If we don’t convince as many people as we can to prevent the harms caused to non-human animals then more needless suffering will occur than if we had been effective in our activism.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> When not saving the world, what fun things do you do in your spare time?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> Haha well thank you for implying that I’m saving the world! I try to spend most of my time working on altruistic projects, but I also see my friends and go out dancing at nightclubs quite a lot.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> Some people feel like “saving the world” all the time is too much and they need some balance in their life, so they might give only 10% of their income and 10% of their time, instead of all of it.  What are your thoughts on this balance?</em></p>

<p><strong>RD:</strong> It would be great if we could all work to help others all the time, we would solve problems very quickly! Unfortunately this kind of lifestyle isn’t sustainable for most people. Apart from a few real life superheroes I know in the EA movement it doesn’t seem possible for people to work all the time, if we burn out and stop working on altruist projects altogether that is a massive loss. So it’s important to have fun. Different people have different personalities and each of us will be able to contribute to a different degree. The trick is to find out how much we are personally able for.</p>

<p><em><strong>PH:</strong> Thank you, Ruairí.  It was great getting to know you better!</em></p>
