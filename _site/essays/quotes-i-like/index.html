      <p><strong>“Everything that follows, is a result of what you see here.”</strong> – Dr. Lanning’s Hologram</p>

<p><strong>“The unexamined life is not worth living.”</strong> – Plato</p>

<p><strong>“[T]herefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting, get understanding.”</strong> – Proverbs 4:7</p>

<p><strong>“Love truth, hate suffering.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“The heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight, but they while their companions slept were toiling upward in the night.”</strong> – Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</p>

<p><strong>“If you don’t have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?”</strong> – John Wooden</p>

<p><strong>“A mere five decades ago, we thought that only white people deserved the front of the bus.  A mere century ago, we thought that woman were too stupid to vote.  Two centuries ago, we thought that only land-owning white men mattered and native americans were things to be killed.  Four centuries ago, we thought that rule by kings was the best way to arrange a government and that our opinions about how the universe was created should be spread by swords.  We’ve come a long way, but it makes you wonder what things we’re doing wrong that will take decades more to uncover.”</strong><!-- more --></p>

<p><strong>“In a society in which the narrow pursuit of material self-interest is the norm, the shift to an ethical stance is more radical than many people realize. In comparison with the needs of people starving in Somalia, the desire to sample the wines of the leading French vineyards pales into insignificance. Judged against the suffering of immobilized rabbits having shampoos dripped into their eyes, a better shampoo becomes an unworthy goal. An ethical approach to life does not forbid having fun or enjoying food and wine, but it changes our sense of priorities.”</strong> – Peter Singer</p>

<p><strong>“There is no community-service requirement in the real world; no one is forcing you to care. You can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and go chasing after the big house and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says that you should want, that you should aspire to, that you can buy. But I hope you don’t walk away from the challenge. Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition.”</strong> – President Obama</p>

<p><strong>“The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You’d be surprised how far that gets you.”</strong> – Neil DeGrasse Tyson</p>

<p><strong>“Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity – in all this vastness – there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. It is up to us.”</strong> – Carl Sagan</p>

<p><strong>“When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”</strong> - John Maynard Keynes</p>

<p><strong>“Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives. I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because it will never come again. What we leave behind is not as important as how we’ve lived. After all Number One, we’re only mortal.”</strong> – Captain Picard</p>

<p><strong>“Philosophize until the end.”</strong> – Dr. Eric Boehme</p>
