Should you "earn to give" or do direct work? <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hjn/earning_to_give_vs_altruistic_career_choice/">Here's one perspective.</a>  Notably, the best people in direct work probably can accomplish a lot of good -- <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/69-how-good-are-the-best">the best 10% can do about 8x as well as the bottom 10%</a>.

Wondering whether you'd be the type of person suited for direct work?  See <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/173-looking-for-a-seriously-high-impact-job-using-your-analytical-skills">Holden Karnofsky talk about who would fit well at GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/ia0/should_you_work_at_80000_hours/">Ben Todd talk about who would fit well at 80,000 Hours</a>, or <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/17-high-impact-interview-1-existential-risk-research-at-siai">Luke talk about who should work for MIRI</a>.

If you think computer programming is the way to go and are only missing the "how to make it happen" step, here's <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/di2/advice_on_getting_a_software_job/">"Advice on Getting a Software Job"</a>, <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hd1/maximizing_your_donations_via_a_job/">"Maximizing Your Donations via a Job"</a>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBkmLrQQiFaBCmB99FXObD4-8h2qVtJf-9EvanOuvvk/edit?usp=sharing">some more resources</a>.  It would be nice to see this for non-programming jobs.

Regardless of what job you try and land, though, <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">don't forget salary negotiation</a>.

Also don't forget to consider academics.  Here's <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/140-how-to-make-a-difference-in-research-an-interview-with-nick-bostrom">Nick Bostrom on how to make a difference as an academic</a>.

Lastly, here's a bunch of people on LessWrong <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ifo/what_should_a_college_student_do_to_maximize/">giving career advice to a new college student</a>.
