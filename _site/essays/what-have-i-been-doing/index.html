Oh, hi there.  I didn't see you.  Come on in.  The blog is back up and running.  Oh, that dust you see there?  I'll have it cleaned off in just a little bit.  But, no, it's ok.  Come on in and make yourself at home.

Me?  You want to know about me?  Well, ok.  Yes, the blog did take a little bit of a break as you may have noticed.  But I've been doing important things, don't you worry.  Just last Saturday I took the LSAT (exam for law school admission) and the Saturday before that I took the GRE (exam for grad school admission) and I had to study for those exams rather than write for this blog.  I even sent in a job application.  What can I say?  I'm keeping my options open.

...I've also been doing a lot of work for my classes -- it was midterm week.  But everything is accomplished now and I should have some time to return to the blog and write some cool things for you.

Stay tuned.
