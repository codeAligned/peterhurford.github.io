<div class="post">
Periodically, in times of blog inactivity, I like to come back and report all the things I've been doing while not blogging.  Here's a complete run down of the more recent:

<b>I finished up Recruitment for my fraternity.</b>  It was basically working a part-time 20hrs/wk job for two weeks doing lots of event planning, but we ended up getting twelve fine men to join our fraternity.  Well worth it!

<b>I've been working with Ozzie Gooen on <a href="http://www.dotimpact.im">.impact</a></b>, a distributed volunteer force working to produce really useful projects.  Here's <a href="https://impact.hackpad.com/Projects-aRiPtncmuKS">a list of projects our group is working on</a> and you can check <a href="http://dotimpact.im/meetings.html">our meetings log</a> for their status.  Besides helping coordinate the group as a whole, I'm also working on building a <a href="http://www.jobboard.im">Job Board</a> (<a href="https://impact.hackpad.com/Job-Board-G2ZocnkVTsc">more details here</a>) and <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/peterhurford.com/document/d/1nA3VYi3-UbAOefSWCNcFQQ2fTIceiX1CkyZMIHO-q2Q/edit">studying vegetarian advocacy</a>.

<b>I've been working on learning more computer programming.</b>  In addition to working on the Job Board, I've begun to work for a friend's startup called <a href="http://www.jorgestradingpost.com">Jorge's Trading Post</a>, doing some PHP development for them.  I've also been learning more Ruby on Rails, Python, and JavaScript.  It helps that I'm now in a Computer Science class and have to program for actual homework.<!--more-->

<b>I have been blogging, some.</b>  I've posted around here, but I've also been posting non-utilitarian stuff (gasp!) on <a href="http://peterhurford.tumblr.com">my Tumblr</a>.

<b>I'm still doing Senior Research.</b>  I'm researching political optimism and the influence of optimism on political behavior.  We just launched our survey recently on <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon's Mechanical Turk</a>.

<b>I'm still <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1024">debating Alonzo Fyfe</a>.</b>  The topic is whether Alonzo Fyfeâ€™s desirism or my two-level utilitarianism is the better theory of utilitarianism.

<b>I'm still involved in the <a href="http://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/service-opportunities/dca">Denison Community Association</a></b>, the umbrella organization for all volunteer service and service learning on Denison's campus.  I'm currently working to figure out how to get more people involved in service.

<b>I'm still involved in <a href="https://orgsync.com/custom_pages/10460/show/8585">Denison Venture Philanthropy</a></b>, a grant-making organization that gives out $10K and 200 volunteer hours to one non-profit each year.  This year, we're working with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/southnewark">South Newark Civic Association</a> to (1) get them a professional website, (2) do a survey-based needs analysis of the community, and (3) put together a booklet of local businesses.  I'm helping work on the website -- not programming, but helping them figure out how to talk to vendors.

<b>I'm still volunteering with <a href="http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>.</b>  Recently, <a href="http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/ace-highlight-organization-evaluation-criteria/">I helped put together</a> some detailed <a href="http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/organization-evaluation-template/">organization evaluation criteria</a> that ACE will use to evaluate organizations going forward.

<b>I'm going to be giving a 12-minute <a href="https://www.ted.com/tedx">TEDx talk</a></b> on <a href="http://www.givewell.org/giving101">effective giving</a> at <a href="http://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/whats-happening/tedxdenisonu">TEDxDenisonU</a> on the 1st of March.
