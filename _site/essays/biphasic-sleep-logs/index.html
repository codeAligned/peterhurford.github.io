      <p>Over the past month, I’ve tried my hand at <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/siesta/">biphasic sleep</a>, which is a fancy way to say “sleep less at night and make up for it with a nap”.  My current plan is to try sleeping for six hours during the night (usually around midnight to 6am or 6:30am) and then nap twenty minutes during the day (usually around 1-1:30pm), though this has changed a lot over time.</p>

<p>Here, I provide a day-by-day log on how things are going.<!-- more --></p>

<h2 id="june-2013">June 2013</h2>

<p><strong>3 June:</strong> Slept 1:45-8:45a [7hrs].  This is normal for my monophonic sleep and is mostly sustainable.  I usually sleep about 51 hours a week when on a disciplined, monophonic sleep schedule.</p>

<p><strong>4 June:</strong> Decided to start biphasic sleep.  Slept from 2-7:30a [5.5hrs].  Woke up very tired, but after having my alarm across the room and drinking water immediately after turning off the alarm, I felt awake like normal.  I had coffee at 8a.  At around 7p I started feeling tired, so at 7:30p I set an alarm to take a 90 minute nap.  I woke up after 60 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>5 June:</strong> Went to sleep at 2:30a and woke up naturally at 6:30a [4hrs] feeling rested.  Decided this was too little sleep and went back to sleep until 7:30a [5hrs].  Woke up feeling very tired and went back to sleep until 7:45a [total sleep 5.25hrs].  Woke up again very tired, but after having alarm across the room / drinking water, I felt awake like normal.  I felt pretty sleepy again at 3p, but this might be because I was at a boring presentation.  At around 3:30p I started waking up again and felt like normal.  I started getting sleepy again around 8p and tried to nap in the car (from Cleveland to Columbus) at 8:30p, but I didn’t fall asleep.  I wasn’t able to take a nap at the time I wanted, and felt very sleepy around 11p.  I tried to take a 1hr nap at 11:30p, but I drifted off to sleep until 7a the next morning.</p>

<p><strong>6 June:</strong> Woke up at 5:30a [6.5hrs] naturally and felt moderately alert, but felt like it was too early, and I went back to sleep.  Woke up again at 6:30a [7hrs] and felt sleepy, so I went back to sleep.  Woke up again at 7a naturally [7.5hrs].  Felt a bit more tired than usual during the morning.  Felt better after I drank water, but felt a bit sleepy again in an hour.  Went for a run that was more sluggish than usual.  Came back feeling alert and felt alert for the rest of the day.</p>

<p><strong>7 June:</strong> Slept 12:30-6a [5.5hrs].  Woke up via alarm in the middle of a dream and what felt like a pretty deep sleep.  I didn’t wake up feeling all that sleepy, and after getting the alarm across the room and drinking some water, I felt totally fine.  Morning activities felt about as sluggish as yesterday morning’s, however, but picked up after going on a walk and taking a lukewarm shower.  The remainder of the day, I felt alert, and felt unusually more effective, productive, and creative.  However, I also felt more grouchy.  I tried to nap 6:30-7p, but two annoyingly spaced phone calls prevented me from falling asleep, though I do recall dreaming.  I started to get tired around 11:45a.</p>

<p><strong>8 June:</strong> Slept at 12:45a.  Had my alarm set for 6a, but it either didn’t go off, I didn’t hear it, or I unconsciously woke up and turned the alarm off (it wasn’t far enough away from my bed like it should be).  I continued to sleep until waking up naturally at 9a [8.25hrs], feeling more tired in the morning than in the past couple of mornings.  Felt better after eating breakfast.  Remained alert until 6p, when I got tired.  I took a nap from 6:30 to 7p.  Still felt tired and continued to nap until 7:30p.  Felt alert for the rest of the day.</p>

<p><strong>9 June:</strong> Started getting really tired around 1:30a, after completing my bodyweight exercise.  I went to bed at 2a and woke up by alarm at 7a [5hrs], but felt tired and didn’t feel motivated enough to want to try and become awake, even though I felt like I could.  So I slept in until 8a [6hrs], and then 8:15a [6.25hrs].  I woke up feeling rather tired still, but while reading, I gradually woke up and felt alert by 9a.  I felt a little sleepy at both 1:30p and 4:15p (both times in a car), but felt alert otherwise, especially after doing bodyweight exercises.</p>

<p><strong>10 June:</strong> Started getting tired around 1a, and I went to bed at 1:30a, with my plan to have the alarm far away and some water to drink.  I set the alarm for 6:30a [5hrs].  I woke up at 8a [6.5hrs] with the alarm in my hand.  I felt tired, so I decided to sleep in to 9a [7.5hrs].  I’m confused as to why waking up worked out really well in the beginning, but then stopped working.  I woke up feeling alert, though, and continued to feel alert until around 10p, when I felt sleepy until about midnight.</p>

<p><strong>11 June:</strong> Got tired around 1a, and I went to bed at 1:30a.  Woke up at 7a [5.5hrs], decided this was too early, and went back to sleep and woke up at 7:30a [6hrs].  Felt tired for a bit, drank some water, and by the time I had clothes on and was downstairs, I felt wide awake.  Continued to remain alert, but took a nap from 7-8:15p anyway, where I managed to fall asleep moderately well.  Woke up feeling very refreshed and alert.</p>

<p><strong>12 June:</strong> Went to sleep at 1:45a and woke up at 7a feeling fine [5.25hrs].  Decided it was too early and I might as well sleep in to 8a [6.25hrs].  Felt a bit tired throughout the day until I ate lunch at 12:30p; afterward I felt fine.  Continued to remain alert until around 7p, which is precisely when I had scheduled a nap.  Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to nap then as I was with a friend, so I continued to remain tired until I napped at 10p.  Woke up at 11:15p feeling refreshed.</p>

<p><strong>13 June:</strong> Got tired around 1:45a, but didn’t go to sleep until 3a, and was fine throughout that time.  Woke up at 8:30a [5.5hrs] feeling fine.  Remained alert and active throughout the day.  Took a nap at 6:45p even though I wasn’t feeling all that tired.  Ended up napping until 8:30p because of some issue with my alarm clock.  Continued to remain alert.</p>

<p><strong>14 June:</strong> Went to sleep at 1:30a and woke up at 7a [5.5hrs].  Felt a little sleepy, so I slept in for 15 minutes [5.75hrs] and woke up feeling fine.  Felt alert throughout the day until around 8p and 12a, both times when I felt tired for about 20 minutes.  Because I was with Katie, I didn’t take any naps.</p>

<p><strong>15 June:</strong> I started nodding off at 2a and had to go to bed before even finishing my episode of Person of Interest.  I decided to sleep in all the way to 9:30a [7.5hrs].  This is strange because it felt like I was massively sleeping in (I woke up feeling like I slept 9 or 10 hours), but was surprised to see that it was my normal sleeping time of 7.5 hours.  I wasn’t too tired at 8p when I decided to take a nap, but I ended up napping for 1.75hrs because it felt nice and I was tired after all.  I woke up from my nap feeling more tired than before I napped.</p>

<p><strong>16 June:</strong> Went to sleep at 2:30a, still not feeling quite tired.  Set the alarm for 8a [5.5hrs] and woke up fine at that time, but fell back asleep without re-setting the alarm, and slept all the way to 10:45a [8.25hrs].</p>

<p><strong>17 June:</strong> Went to sleep at 2a, still not feeling quite tired.  Set the alarm for 7a [5hrs], but decided to sleep in until 7:30a [5.5hrs].  I was pretty sleepy waking up, but shook out of it in about three minutes.  Was alert the entire day.  Took a nap 6:45-7:45p.  I didn’t feel tired, but I was able to fall asleep fine and woke up feeling tired, but was able to quickly shake out of it.</p>

<p><strong>18 June:</strong> Went to sleep at 2:30a feeling tired.  Meant to wake up at 7:30a [5hrs], but ended up falling back asleep and woke up at 9:15a [6.75hrs].  Earlier I had been in the practice of going back to sleep for 15 more minutes, but this is proving to be too dangerous.  I need to take extra care to not fall back asleep after I wake up.  Took a nap at 7:45-8:30p, and felt tired after waking up from the nap but was later fine.</p>

<p><strong>19 June:</strong> Went to sleep at 2:30a, not feeling all that tired.  Aimed to wake up at 7:30a [5hrs], but chose to go back to sleep and wake up at 8:15a [5.75hrs] instead.  Forgot to nap earlier and ended up in a position where I couldn’t.  I got really, really tired around 10p.  Eventually I just went to bed.</p>

<p><strong>20 June:</strong> Following being really, really tired, I went to bed at 12:30a and slept all the way to 9:30a [9hrs].  Got tired at 10:30p.</p>

<p><strong>21 June:</strong> Went to bed at 2am, pretty tired.  Woke up at 7:30a [5.5hrs].  Decided to go back to sleep for 15 minutes.  Forgot to reset the alarm, and ended up waking up at 10a [8hrs].  This is a recurring theme, and I really need to stop letting myself go back to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>22 June:</strong> Went to bed at 1:30am and woke up at 8:30am [7hrs], because I knew I wouldn’t be able to get a nap in today.  It’s now been four straight days where I haven’t been able to get a nap in, which is derailing the plan.  I owe this to having a summer schedule where I regularly spend something like 5-11p with either my girlfriend or my family.  I wish I could be strict about getting a nap, but I can’t, and that’s ok, but frustrating for this experiment.  Maybe I could try and experiment with getting an early nap in?</p>

<p><strong>23 June:</strong> Got pretty sleepy around midnight and decided to go to bed early at 12:30a.  Knew I was really tired and still probably wouldn’t be able to nap, decided  to sleep until 8a [7.5hrs].</p>

<p><strong>24 June:</strong> I intended to go to sleep at 2:30a, but I was so sleepy that I went to bed at 2:15a, pausing my television show half-way through.  I woke up at 8:30a [6.25hrs].  I took a nap at 7:45p and woke up at 9p rather tired.  After I showered, however, I no longer felt tired.</p>

<p><strong>25 June:</strong> I went to sleep at 1:30a, intending to wake up at 6:30a [5hrs].  I woke up in the middle of the night at 4:30a [3hrs] feeling pretty rested, but went back to sleep.  I ended up waking at 10a [8.5hrs], much to minor disaster.  My alarms are in working order, and I have no idea how this happened.</p>

<p><strong>26 June:</strong> Went to sleep at 1:45a feeling pretty tired and woke up at 7:45a [6hrs] feeling fine.  This is a deliberate shift from a 5hrs core sleep + 1hr nap to a 6hrs core sleep + 30min nap, because the 5hrs sleep had started to fail with sleeping in, and this seemed more sustainable.  Today, I took a practice LSAT test from 11:15a to 1:45p and found no trouble with the questions or the focus, getting a score of 167.  I took a nap from 3:45p to 4:30p and felt very refreshed afterward, unlike past naps which lead me to feel even more tired after waking up.</p>

<p><strong>27 June:</strong> I went to sleep at 12:30a, aiming to wake up at 6:30a [6hrs].  I woke up pretty tired and ended up sleeping in to 7a [6.5hrs].  After I woke up, I felt very tired until about 8:30a.  I didn’t have a cup in my room, so I wasn’t able to drink water easily, and I think that would have helped.  I took a nap at 4:15p and woke up at 4:45p feeling refreshed.</p>

<p><strong>28 June:</strong> I went to sleep at 1a, aiming to wake up at 7a [6hrs].  Like the previous day, I woke up pretty tired and ended up sleeping in until 7:45a [6.75hrs].  I never felt like I needed a nap.  I ended up pretty tired around 6:30p in the car, but snapped out of it.</p>

<p><strong>29 June:</strong> I got tired around 12:45a and went to sleep at 1:15a.  Knew I wouldn’t nap during the day, so I decided to sleep as long as I wanted.  Ended up getting up at 9:45a [8.5hrs].  Wasn’t tired for the rest of the day.</p>

<p><strong>30 June:</strong> I got tired around 12:30a and went to sleep at 1:15a.  I again decided to sleep as long as I wanted and woke up at 10:15a [9hrs].</p>

<h2 id="july-2013">July 2013</h2>

<p><strong>1 July:</strong> I got tired around 12:30a and went to sleep at 1:15a.  I woke up at 7:15a [6hrs] and then went back to sleep for fifteen minutes [6.25hrs].  Woke up great with no grogginess.  Felt a bit tired around 4p and napped from 4:30-5:15p.</p>

<p><strong>2 July:</strong> Felt tired around 12:30a and went to sleep at 1a.  Woke up at 7a [6hrs], but then fell back asleep without resetting my alarm.  I ended up waking up at 8a [7hrs].  I also took a nap from 4:45-5:15p and felt tired at 10p.</p>

<p><strong>3 July:</strong> Felt tired around 12:30a, but didn’t go to sleep until around 2a.  Woke up at 8a [6hrs], but then – just like yesterday – fell back asleep without resetting my alarm.  I ended up waking up at 9a [7hrs].  I felt actually pretty tired around 4p, so I took a nap.  I ended up waking up naturally and pretty well-rested just fifteen minutes later.  I ended up getting pretty tired around 10p.</p>

<p><strong>4 July:</strong> Felt tired around 12:30a and went to sleep then.  Woke up at 6:30a [6hrs] and wanted to go to back sleep.  But I was using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kog.alarmclock&amp;hl=en">the “I Can’t Wake Up” Alarm Clock</a> which won’t turn off until you complete various puzzle tasks, like math problems.  I was alert then after.  I ended up snapping awake a few minutes into doing the puzzles.  I later took a nap at 3:30p, woke up naturally around 3:45p, but decided to go back to sleep and woke up with the alarm at 4p feeling refreshed.  I got pretty sleepy around 8p, but woke myself up successfully by putting some cold water on the back of my neck.  After that, I remained alert for the rest of the day.</p>

<p><strong>5 July:</strong> Went to sleep at 1a and woke up at 7a [6hrs]. Like yesterday, I wanted to go back to sleep and would have, if not for the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kog.alarmclock&amp;hl=en">the “I Can’t Wake Up” Alarm Clock</a> which won’t turn off until you complete various puzzle tasks, like math problems.  The rest of the day felt a bit sluggish and forgetful, but I still managed to do a lot.  I didn’t take my nap till 5:15p, but I didn’t feel tremendously tired before then, either.  I woke up feeling refreshed like usual.  I ended up getting <em>very</em> tired around 10p, basically falling asleep on the couch.  I probably could have done something to shake it off (drink something, splash myself with water, etc.), but chose not to.</p>

<p><strong>6 July:</strong> Went to sleep at 1a, but had some trouble falling asleep and didn’t really fall asleep until 1:30a.  I woke up at 7:30a [6hrs] just fine, but felt absolutely dead – I can’t remember ever feeling more tired before.  So I went back to sleep for a half hour and woke up at 8a [6.5hrs], feeling much better.  I was noticeably more alert and creative than yesterday, but I still was rather forgetful throughout the day.  I took a nap from 3:30-3:50p – I had a bit of trouble falling asleep for it, but woke up for it well rested.</p>

<p><strong>7 July:</strong> Went to sleep at 12:45a and woke up at 6:30a [5.75hrs].  Felt surprisingly great – I’m not sure if it was the increased sleep from yesterday or the decreased sleep today (and presumably better time to wake up).  Napped 4:15-4:35p.  Didn’t feel tired until 11:30p.</p>

<p><strong>8 July:</strong> Went to sleep at midnight and woke up at 6:30a [6.5hrs].  Felt a little sluggish getting up, but went the rest of the day feeling normal.  I took a nap from 1:30-2p and it went well.  I didn’t have my usual 10:30p crash.</p>

<p><strong>9 July:</strong> Went to sleep at 12:15a and woke up at 6a [5.75hrs].  Felt pretty tired and continued to feel tired until around 10a.  Exercise and a shower woke me up, but briefly.  What did end up energizing me, however, was getting deeply involved in tasks, taking my nap, and perhaps sugar.  After my nap, I felt fine for the rest of the day.  I napped 12:45-1:05p. I woke up in the middle of the nap (after ten minutes, but it felt like an hour) and went back to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>10 July:</strong> Went to sleep at 12a (sort of) and woke up at 6:30a (sort of) [6.5hrs].  I had some trouble going to sleep.  I also woke up a bit early (didn’t check the time) and went back to sleep.  I think I was nervous about taking my driver’s test today.  I ended up failing my test.  I didn’t feel tired at all during the test, but this could be taken as evidence of general cognitive decline.  I took a nap 2-2:30p.  Tomorrow I will be going to Oxford, England, so to help prepare for the change in timezones, I went to sleep at 11p EDT / 4a WEST.</p>

<p><strong>11 July:</strong> I’m still at home, but I will be traveling to Oxford, England today.  I woke up really early at 4:45a EDT / 9:45a WEST [5.75hrs] in preparation for the time zone switch.  My sleep at night wasn’t the best, with some trouble falling asleep and multiple wake ups in the middle of the night.  I did not record when my wake ups were.  After waking up, I didn’t feel all that tired, but I definitely felt more sluggish than ever before, and wasn’t able to accomplish anything other than reading in the first hour.</p>

<p><strong>12 July:</strong> Heading to Oxford, I slept on plane from 2-5:30a WEST [3.5hrs].  I napped from 12:30-1p.  Overall, I felt more fine than I would expect, but things were a bit hazy and I had some trouble focusing on things.  I suspect this means I’m getting enough sleep from my normal biphasic schedule, since I was able to survive the truncated sleep.  I had some microsleeping throughout the second trip to Wales, and also took an unintentional twenty minute nap.</p>

<p><strong>13 July:</strong> I went to sleep at 1a and woke up at 7:30a [6.5hrs].  I woke up pretty tired and was having some microsleeps.  I napped 12-12:30p and felt much better afterward.</p>

<p><strong>14 July:</strong> I stayed up until 2:30a talking to people.  I then decided to sleep as long as I wanted to help with jet lag and inconsistent bed times, and ended up waking up at noon [9.5hrs].  I felt much better.</p>

<p><strong>15 July:</strong> I went to sleep at 11:30a, but had a lot of trouble falling asleep, and didn’t fall asleep until 12:45a.  I woke up at 6:45a [6hrs].  I did not nap.  I felt pretty awake until midnight.</p>

<p><strong>16 July:</strong> I went to sleep at 1a, feeling fairly tired.  I was sleeping on a couch, which was comfy, but not the best.  I woke up at 7a [6hrs], but felt tired.  My alarm had not been set up to demand an extended wake up time, so I was able to fall back asleep.  I then woke up at 8a [7hrs], but didn’t feel any better.  I also did not take a nap.</p>

<p><strong>17 July:</strong> I went to sleep at 12:30p, but had a bit of trouble falling asleep.  I was sleeping on a nice bed, this time.  I woke up naturally at 5:30a [5.5hrs], but decided to go back to bed until 7:15a [6.75hrs].  I was pretty hazy and tired for the morning.  I took a nap from 11:15 to 11:45a and felt good after that.</p>

<p><strong>18 July:</strong> I went to sleep at 12:45p.  I woke up at 6:45a [6hrs], but even after my alarm, still felt really sleepy, so I went back to sleep and woke up at 7:15a [6.5hrs] and then again at 7:45a [7hrs].  I took a nap at 11:15a.  I felt sufficiently awake all day.</p>

<p><strong>19 July:</strong> I went to sleep at midnight.  I woke up naturally at 6:18a, but went back to sleep until 6:30a [6.5hrs].  I felt pretty tired after waking up and was struggling to stay awake.  Half an hour later, I ended up taking my nap <em>very</em> early, from 7:30-8a.  After that, I felt like normal and was sufficiently awake all day.</p>

<p><strong>20 July:</strong> I went to sleep at 1a.  I forgot to set my alarm and slept in until 9a [8hrs].  I felt like normal and was sufficiently awake all day.</p>

<p><strong>21 July:</strong> I went to sleep at 2a.  I woke up naturally at 6:18a [4.25hrs], but went back to sleep until 7:30a [6hrs], but even after my alarm, still felt really sleepy, so I went back to sleep and woke up at 9a [7hrs].  I didn’t take a nap.  I felt like normal and was sufficiently awake all day until I started getting tired around 11p.</p>

<p><strong>22 July:</strong> I don’t know what happened.  I must have been sick or something, because I felt terrible.  I went to bed at midnight and woke up at 6:15a by alarm [6.25hrs].  But then I decided to go back to sleep.  I then continued to repeat this process for more than three hours, finally getting out of bed at 9:30a [9.5hrs].  I even spent about half an hour asleep on the floor of my room.  I felt like normal the rest of the day.</p>

<p><strong>23 July:</strong> The same thing that happened to me yesterday happened again.   I went to bed at 1a and woke up at 7a by alarm [6hrs].  But then I decided to go back to sleep.  I then continued to repeat this process for more than three hours, finally getting out of bed at 9:45a [8.75hrs].  I felt like normal the rest of the day.</p>

<p><strong>24 July:</strong>  I went to sleep at 12:30a.  I woke up at 6:30a [6hrs].  I was not able to nap due to time constraints.  I felt pretty tired at 11a, but felt awake the rest of the day.  At some points I think I was a bit more forgetful than usual, but I still found myself creative and intelligent.</p>

<p><strong>25 July:</strong>  I went to sleep at 12:15a and I woke up at 6:45a [6hrs].  I felt pretty tired throughout the day and went through two “dead periods” – 10-10:30a and 2-2:30p where I basically kept falling asleep.  I eventually was able to nap from 3:30-4:30p.  Afterwards, I felt normal.</p>

<p><strong>26 July:</strong>  I went to sleep at 12:30a and I woke up at 7:00a [6.5hrs] and napped from 11:30a-noon.  The day felt normal and nice.</p>

<p><strong>27 July:</strong> I decided to shake things up and switch sleep schedules to <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/dual-core/">Dual Core 1</a>.  I slept from 11p-2:30a [3.5hrs], from 5:30-8:30a [3hrs, total 6hrs], and napped from 3:30-3:50a [20min, total 6.3hrs].  I felt a little groggy in between the core sleeps (2:30-5:30a), but felt great the rest of the day.  Note that ideally the second core is supposed to be shorter.  I actually woke up naturally around 6:30a or so, but went back to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>28 July:</strong> Dual Core 1 didn’t go so well this time.  I slept from 11p-2:30a [3.5hrs], but woke up more tired than I had ever felt in a long time, and ended up going back to bed after only half an hour.  I then slept all the way until 8p [5hrs, 8.5hrs total].  I still felt tired throughout the day, so I took a nap from 3-3:20p [8.8hrs total].</p>

<p><strong>29 July:</strong> I woke up from my 11p-2:30a [3.5hrs] initial core fine, but felt pretty tired.  I went to bed at 4:30a and then ended up sleeping in all the way until 8:30a [4hrs, 7.5hrs total].  I felt fine until about 3p, when I felt really tired again.  I ended up napping from 4:15-4:35p [20min, 7.8hrs total].</p>

<p><strong>30 July:</strong>  I woke up from an 11p-2a [3hrs] core sleep and felt much better than before, indicating that this was probably a much better time to wake up.  However, I didn’t feel very motivated to do anything and ended up putting my head down.  I quickly fell back asleep until 4a [5hrs total].  I also slept from 6-7a [6hrs total], 10-10:20a [6.3hrs total], and 4:50-5:10p [6.6hrs total].  I felt pretty sleepy around 3p again.  (Ideally I would nap then, but I was still at work.)</p>

<p><strong>31 July:</strong>  I went to sleep at 12:15a.  I woke up at 3:15a [3hrs] and felt pretty good, but then ended up falling asleep in a way I still don’t quite understand and sleeping all the way until 8:45a [8.5hrs total].  I didn’t nap the rest of the day.  I felt a little tired at 3p, but otherwise felt fine.</p>

<h2 id="aug-2013">Aug 2013</h2>

<p><strong>1 Aug:</strong>I went to sleep at 12:15a.  I woke up at 3:15a [3hrs] and felt pretty good and managed to stay awake for an hour, but I then again ended up falling asleep in a way I still don’t quite understand and sleeping all the way until 8:30a [7.25hrs total].  I didn’t nap the rest of the day.  I felt a little tired at 3p, but otherwise felt fine.</p>

<p><strong>2 Aug:</strong> Today I spent only five hours and ten minutes asleep, but felt better than I’ve felt in a long time.  I went to bed at midnight and woke up at 3a [3hrs].  I then went to bed at 5a and woke up at 6:30a [1.5hrs, 4.5hrs total].  I took a nap at 8:30a and a nap at 3:30p [5.1hrs total].  I had a noticable slump at 2p (if only I could nap earlier) and I feel like the 8:30a nap may be unnecessary.  We’ll see if this is just a one time thing or something sustainable.</p>

<p><strong>3 Aug:</strong> It looks like one time thing; things blew up again.  I went to bed at 10:45p and woke up at 1:45a [3hrs].  I felt pretty sleepy at first, but was able to snap out of it.  I then went to bed at 4:30a.  The trouble is I went to bed again after I woke up, and didn’t wake up until 10:30a [6hrs, 9hrs total].  Time to try again.</p>

<p><strong>4 Aug:</strong> Today went pretty well.  I went to bed at 11p and woke up at 2a [3hrs].  I then went to bed at 4:30a and woke up at 5:30a [1hr, 4hrs total].  I took a nap at 8:30a and a nap at 3:30p, but overslept the nap at 3:30p by an hour [6.1hrs total].  I didn’t feel all that tired at any point during the day.</p>

<p><strong>5 Aug:</strong> Today also went well.  I went to sleep at 11:30p and woke up at 2:30a [3hrs].  I felt kind of fine, but spent two hours watching television because I never felt awake enough to be motivated to do productive work.  Eventually I got caught up chatting people online who were in a different timezone, and didn’t end up going back to sleep again until 6a.  I chose to sleep longer, sleeping until 8a [2hrs, 5hrs total] and then skipped my 8a nap.  I then napped when I got home at 4:30p [20mins, 5.3hrs total] and napped a third time at 7p [20mins, 5.5hrs total] before going out to dinner.  I felt pretty awake throughout the day after waking up from the second sleep at 8a.  This 3hr - 2hr - 20 min - 20min split might be an interesting model to continue rather than my previous 3hr - 1hr - 20min - 20min.</p>

<p><strong>6 Aug:</strong> I went to sleep at 11p and woke up at 2a [3hrs] like planned, but then fell back asleep until 6:30a [7.5hrs total].  I took a nap at 8:30a [8hrs total].</p>

<p><strong>7 Aug:</strong> I went to sleep at 1a and woke up at 4a [3hrs].  I then went to sleep again at 5:45a, but overslept this one until 8:30a [2.75hrs, 5.75hrs total].  I napped at 5:30p because that was when I got home [20mins, 6.1hrs total].  Overall, despite the oversleep, I still didn’t sleep that much relative to a monophasic schedule and felt pretty awake throughout the day.</p>

<p><strong>8 Aug:</strong> I went to sleep at midnight and decided to try and sleep until 4a this time [4hrs] to see if I would feel more awake when I woke up.  I woke up twice during this time period, once at 1a [1hr] and another time I didn’t record.  I didn’t feel all that more awake.  I went back to sleep at 6a and woke up at 6:40a [40min, 4.6hrs total] feeling much better.  I felt a little tired around 10a, but felt awake otherwise throughout the day.  I took a nap at 8:30a [20min, 4.9hrs total].  I also took another nap at 3:30p when I got back home and ended up oversleeping it a bit, sleeping for an hour [5.9hrs total].</p>

<p><strong>9 Aug:</strong> I slept from 12a to 4a [4hrs] and woke up feeling fine.  I went back to bed at 6a and ended up oversleeping to 8:15a [2.25hrs, 6.25hrs total].  I also took a nap at 4p that I ended up oversleeping until 6:45p [2.75hrs, 9hrs total].</p>

<p><strong>10 Aug:</strong> I went to bed at 12:30a, woke up and then immediately fell back asleep, sleeping until 9:15a [8.75hrs].  Yet I still felt a bit tired throughout the day.</p>

<p><strong>11 Aug:</strong> I decided to switch to an <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/everyman/">Everyman Schedule</a> and just try to see how long I can maintain consistent times.  Today, things went fine.  I slept 1-4a [3hrs] and napped at 8:30a [20mins, 3.3hrs total], 3:30p [20mins, 3.6hrs total], and 8:30p [20mins, 4hrs total].  It was amazing to feel pretty good throughout the day on only four hours sleep.  It certainly made the day feel very long.  The only problem was I crashed a bit at 11:30a, almost falling asleep.  We’ll see if this can last more than one day.</p>

<p><strong>12 Aug:</strong> I ended up going to bed at 1a and woke up at 4a [3hrs].  I felt oddly not sleepy, but ended up going back to sleep anyway for some reason (I think I was a bit delirious) and woke up again at 5:30a [4.5hrs].  I napped at 8a and overslept to 9a [1hrs, 5.5hrs total].  I also napped at 3:30p and 7:15p [20mins each, 6.1hrs total].  Most of the day went fine, but I had a crash at 6:30a where I felt really tired and even fell asleep for maybe 5-10 minutes around 7a without noticing I had fallen asleep.  I also had a crash around 2p.</p>

<p><strong>13 Aug:</strong> I went to bed at 12:30a and woke up at 4a [3.5hrs] and felt oddly not sleepy but again went back to sleep for some reason and didn’t wake up until 7:45a [7.25hrs total].  I felt tired around 10:30a and napped at 11:15a [7.5hrs total] but didn’t really fall asleep because I was on a couch near a noisy fan.  I also napped at 5:30p and overslept this nap to 7:30p [2hrs, 9.5hrs total].  I felt pretty good and awake after that nap.</p>

<p><strong>14 Aug:</strong> Pretty much the same thing a third time.  I went to bed at 1:30a and woke up at 7:30a [6hrs] after going back to sleep unintentionally.  I took naps at 8:30a, 11:30a, and 3:30p [7hrs total].</p>

<p><strong>15 Aug:</strong> I went to bed at midnight and woke up at 3a successfully [3hrs], but woke up pretty sleepy.  I napped from 5 to 5:40a, 7:30-9a, and 3:30-3:50p [5.5hrs total].  The 7:30a nap was an oversleep.</p>

<p><strong>16 Aug:</strong> I went to bed at 12:30a, woke up at 4a and went back to sleep until 6:30a [6hrs].  I napped at 8:30a and 3:30p.  I was pretty tired before my 8:30a nap.</p>

<p><strong>17 Aug:</strong> I went to bed at 12a, woke up at 4a and went back to sleep until 9:15a [9.25hrs].  I did not nap.</p>

<p><strong>18 Aug:</strong> I initially tried to go to bed at 11p (on the 17th), but was woken up to socialize.  I ended up going to bed at 1a.  I slept till 4a [3hrs] and napped at 6a and 8:30a [3.6hrs total].  I felt pretty active and awake throughout the entire day.  Where things got weird was I took a third nap at 4:45p, woke up a little tired and went back to sleep, and then didn’t wake up until 7:45p [3hrs, 6.6hrs total].</p>

<p><strong>19 Aug:</strong> I went to bed at 12:30a and woke up at 6a [5.5hrs].  I napped at 8:30 [20min, 5.8hrs total] and 5:45p [1hr, 6.8hrs total].  Sleeping the full hour at 5:45p was a mistake and I woke up very tired.</p>

<p><strong>20 Aug:</strong> I went to bed at 10:30p the previous day and woke up at 4a [5.5hrs].  The 5.5hrs core seems stable.  I napped at 6:30a, 8:30a, and 4:30p [20mins each, 6.5hrs total].</p>

<p><strong>21/22 Aug:</strong> I spent this time traveling and slept on planes erraticly, so I didn’t log it.</p>
