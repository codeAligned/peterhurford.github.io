An interesting way to <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/variable-pricing">use variable pricing to allow trade-offs between time and money</a>:  "Mary puts up three signs on the side of the truck: $2, $3, and $5. As people come for pizza she asks them to make three lines, one for each sign, based on how much they want to pay. [...] The $2 line is long[. ...] Some people would rather have pizza sooner than money and wait in the $3 line. [...] Mary makes more money, the people who can afford to pay less get cheaper pizza, and the people in a hurry now have an option to trade off time and money."

When saying there's "no evidence" for something, keep in mind that there are actually <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/08/doctor-there-ar.html">two kinds of "no evidence"</a> -- either no evidence has turned up despite looking really hard with the right methods or no evidence has come up yet because no one has bothered to look.  Only the first one is necessarily damning to a hypothesis.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrVlq2AgwyA">The Kaye effect</a> is pretty cool: "They have made a video of leaping shampoo, in which they explain the so-called Kaye effect.  Kaye in Nature magazine in 1963 wrote 'I can offer no explanation for this behaviour.'  At high-speed recording of 1000 frames per second the following observations were made in 300ms interval: 1) a heap is formed, 2) a streamer ejects, 3) the outgoing jet rises, 4) hits the incoming jet, 5) ends the Kaye effect."

Cal Newport writes about how you can find pretty amazing-sounding accomplishments by <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/08/21/do-you-want-to-succeed-in-college-admissions-finish-something/">just doing something interesting and follow through</a>.

If you have a hard problem, one way to solve it is to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/7t2/hard_problem_hack_away_at_the_edges/">hack away at the edges</a>, working on subproblems until something comes up.

<a href="http://countinganimals.com/factory-farming-and-the-price-of-meat/">Factory farming doesn't actually reduce the price of meat</a>.  While factory farming does reduce the cost it takes to produce meat, producers are keeping the extra savings as profit and not reducing prices.

From the department of audacious philanthropy, this family <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/opinion/24kristof.html?_r=2&">sold their house and donated half of the proceeds</a> and bought a smaller house.

The Battle of Hoth proves that both the Rebels and the Empire are <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/battle-of-hoth/">complete, total idiots when it comes to military strategy</a>.

<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/16/google-correlate-does-not-imply-google-causation/">Google Correlate Does Not Imply Google Causation</a>. Hilarity + statistics.
