Another month, another opportunity to review how my life is going and make sure I'm doing everything I want to do, the way I want to do it.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Did October Go?</h2>
<b>Points:</b> My goal was to score 11400 "daypoints" over the month according to my <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/resolutions-update-june-edition/">scoring system</a> where different habits of mine are assigned different point values for each day.  I earned 11422.5 points (100.1%), which means I succeeded, but barely.  Note that 1-6 Oct was not included because I was late to start my monthly review and 16-20 Oct was not included because I was on vacation.

<b>Time on task:</b> This month I spent an average of 10.7 hours a day working (a 74.9 hour work week), which is down from September's 81.5 hour work week, but up from August's 69.5 hour work week.  Note that work includes everything I do that's not sleep, reading, eating, exercising, showering, getting dressed, hanging out with friends/family, video games, spacing out, watching TV, and other commonsense things.

<b>Time with friends/family:</b> I spent an average of 3.3 hours a day with friends/family.

<b>Exercise:</b> I spent an average of 64.5 minutes a day <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/logs/">doing exercise</a>, mostly <a href="http://www.stronglifts.com/">Stronglifts</a> and some running.  I improved my lifts (boosted my Squat from 135lbs to 155lbs, Bench from 75lbs to 80lbs, and Deadlift from 195lbs to 215lbs) and my running distance (from 4.5mi to 5.2mi).

<b>Other Goals:</b> I met my goals for sleeping 75% of the time, breakfast 90% of the time, lunch 90%, dinner 50%, not snacking 45%, cleanliness 93%, and order 88%.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Is New for November?</h2>
Actually, I'm going to take what I did for October and do it over again, with the same goals and scoring system.  I aim to collect 16200 points.
