          <h2>One Week in Oxford</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Jul 2013</p>

<div class="post">
Earlier, I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/off-to-oxford/">mentioned I had flown off to Oxford, England</a> to be a full-time intern for <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>.  Now that I've spent a week here, I'd like to provide some observations about being an American living in British culture.<!--more-->

<b>Two caveats before we begin</b>
1.) This is a little off-topic from the whole "utilitarianism" thing.  Normally, I put off-topic stuff in <a href="http://www.peterhurford.com/writing.html">the writing section</a> of <a href="http://www.peterhurford.com">personal website</a>.  But, by popular demand, it's here instead.

2.) For some of these cases, it's difficult to tell if my remarks are for all of the United Kingdom, or just the Oxford area.  Also, I'm not sure if it's a regional thing (being in more of a city area than a suburb area) or a United Kingdom thing.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now, the observations!

<b>#1: People drive on the wrong side of the road.</b>  This still blows my mind.  It's true that it doesn't matter what side of the road a society drives on as long as everyone agrees.  But the UK is in the minority on this.  Wikipedia has <a href="">a surprisingly lengthy article on left- and right-hand traffic</a>, noting that "about 72% of the world's total road distance carries traffic on the right [American style] and 28% on the left [UK style]".  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Countries_driving_on_the_left_or_right.svg">Here's a handy map.</a>

<b>#2: The steering wheel is on the wrong side of the car.</b>  Also blows my mind.  It's strange to be looking at a car and think you're looking at the passenger, when actually you're looking at the driver.  Even weirder when at first glance the car has no driver!

<b>#3: They use the metric system, but this comes up surprisingly infrequently.</b>  Most people talk about the temperature, but I'm already used to Celsius as a more sensible temperature system.  The only other time I've needed to think about metric is when stepping on a scale.

<b>#4: They speak English, <i>sort of</i>.</b>  British people use less slang than I expected, but I still don't understand quite a few phrases.  "Wheat bread" is "brown bread", "sun screen" is "sun cream", "power cut" instead of "power failure", etc.  It's like they have a secret codebook of phrases, and I'm not invited.

<b>#5: The comparison between Oxford and New York was greatly exaggerated.</b>  I still haven't seen anything here taller than four stories.

<b>#6: Everyone bikes.</b> This is kind of like New York, except even more so.  Biking is, by far, the most common method of transportation.  I like that.

<b>#7: The outlet is weird.</b>  British electrical outlets <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BS_1363">look like this</a>, as compared to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEMA_connector#NEMA_5">American ones</a>.  At least it's not the Danish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_outlet#Danish_Section_107-2-D1_.2810.2F13.2F16.C2.A0A.2F250.C2.A0V_earthed.29.28Type_K.29">smiley-face plug</a>.
