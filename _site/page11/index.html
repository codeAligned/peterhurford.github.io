    <p>One interesting idea comes from <a href="http://thelifeyoucansave.blogspot.com/2009/06/special-guest-blog.html">“How Students Can Support a Millennium Village?”</a>, which talks about, obviously, funding a Millenium Village:  (See also <a href="http://newsroom.carleton.ca/2009/04/02/carleton-students-approve-student-levy-for-millennium-villages-project/">the school’s news report</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last year at Carleton University our group, Students To End Extreme Poverty, worked to get a question to referendum where students voted on whether or not they would all have to automatically pay an additional $6 in tuition fees ($5352 instead of $5346) to help support a Millennium Village. It worked. Carleton students now contribute over $110,000 annually.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is our hope: By getting enough universities and organizations to support Millennium Villages (aside from helping a couple communities help themselves out of extreme poverty) it would raise enough awareness, get enough media attention, engage enough people, foster enough cooperation, and generate enough civil society will to see policy changes: more and better aid, fairer trade, and debt cancellation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Worst case scenario: thousands of people, many of whom would otherwise be dead, will have the basic tools they need to lift themselves out of extreme poverty.</p>

<p>Might this be a plausible thing to try and do on other college campuses?

Careers are important because having one will not only mean that I won’t starve, but that I’ll have an opportunity to <em>change the world</em>.  As the career advice organization <a href="http://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a> notes you’ll be spending about 80,000 hours in a career, so you might as well use it to make as big of a difference as you can?  <strong>But what career should I pick?</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>My <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/category/resolutions/">New Years Resolutions</a> have been greatly boosting my day-to-day behaviors so that I become the kind of person that has good diet, good fitness, and good productivity.  However, I’ve decided that I want to not just focus on my day-to-day, but my behaviors from “30,000 feet” or “year-to-year”, so to speak.  I want to set goals and be more strategic.</p>

<p>This is the essay where I do some goal setting for the next year.  Right now, I think I’ll commit to revising this plan every six months (November and May), but I reserve the right to change that.

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p><strong>Why blog?</strong>  In Harry Potter, Dumbledore stores his thoughts in a <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pensieve">pensieve</a>.  However, such magical technology already exists for us in a less awesome form: diaries and blogs.</p>

<p>The desire to blog nearly has always started with me feeling overwhelmed by having too many thoughts in my head.  I notice that I can’t think clearly, because focusing on one thought in particular ends up with me losing some of my other thoughts.  This creates a somewhat unpleasant feeling and loss of focus.</p>

<p>But the pensieve model brings a solution – I can make use of what has been called by certain academics as an “external memory field”, and by most nearly everyone else as “paper” or “word documents” to type up my thoughts.  Then, I can get rid of my thoughts from my (internal) mind and think without worry of loss.</p>

<p>Spencer Greenberg writes that <a href="http://www.spencergreenberg.com/2011/07/do-we-really-read-non-fiction-to-learn/">it’s rather pointless to try to read non-fiction with the intent to learn</a> unless you’re also taking notes, potentially doubling the effectiveness of your time spent reading or more.  Since I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-reading/">read a lot of books</a>, it would behoove me to summarize what I’ve read to make sure that I actually learn the material.</p>

<p>I can then come back to thoughts that I’ve stored days, weeks, months, or years older and retrieve them.  It’s really fun to read what I wrote a year ago and try to shift back into my old frame of mind.  Sometimes, old writing of mine is as unfamiliar to me as the writing of other people.

Presumably, if the person is guilty, and they have some sort of evidence of their own guilt, than shouldn’t they ought to be compelled to provide that evidence, given that it helps put punish a guilty person?  The problems, then, are really in the nature of the coercion and whether this coercion would negatively effect innocent people enough as to be worth it.  But that seems better stopped by outlawing “cruel and unusual tactics” and regulating interrogation better.  To be clear, I’m not saying I don’t like the “right to remain silent”, just that I can’t currently make sense of it.</p>

    <p><strong>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/giving-now-currently-seems-to-beat-giving-later/">Giving Now Currently Seems To Beat Giving Later</a></strong></p>

<p>Thinking about <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">analyzing cost-effectiveness for vegetarian outreach</a>, has made me think more about where philanthropic dollars should go in order to do the most amount of good.  Most people just give to whatever charities come their way, send them advertisements, etc.  A lot of people are also concerned with giving back to their local community, supporting their church, or their university.</p>

<p>I don’t condemn any of those motivations – I think they’re wonderful, local communities do deserve support, and there’s something to be said for “paying it forward” and giving back to those who have set you up for success.  But I’m mostly concerned with what one should do with the goal to <a href="">improve the world as much as possible</a> (on the assumption that all interests count equally), and I’ve changed the way I think.

    <p>Among those people interested in doing as much as they can to make the world a better place and think donating their money as effectively as possible is a good way to do that, there is a debate about whether one should either (a) donate a specific portion of one’s income in small installments each year or (b) invest one’s income and then donate as much as possible in one large lump sum right before death.  Of course, there are other positions – like donate every month or donate every decade, but in a very relevant sense the debate is between two options: “give now” vs. “give later”.</p>

<p>In this essay, I will defend the “give now” camp and rebut the “give later” camp, thus explaining why I will continue to donate once a year, though think any sort of regular time period smaller than each year is probably also acceptable.

    <p><strong>Continuation of <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/buying-vegetarians-handling-complications/">Buying Vegetarians: Handling Complications</a></strong></p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been trying to figure out how much it costs to save animals from factory farming. The idea is to get people to become vegetarian by funding advertisements to influence them.  Previously <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">I did a simple calculation</a> and came up with two cents to avert a year of suffering in a factory farm.  Then <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/buying-vegetarians-handling-complications/">I did a more complex calculation</a> and came up with a range between two cents to $65.92 to avert a year of suffering.</p>

<p>Many people are skeptical of these figures.  Perhaps surprisingly, so am I.  I’m trying to strike a balance between being an advocate of vegan outreach as a very promising path for making the world a better place, while not losing sight of the methodological hurdles that have not yet been met, and open to the possibility that I’m <em>wrong about this</em>.</p>

<p>In this essay, I’m going to discuss those hurdles.

    <p><strong>Continuation of <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">How Much Does It Cost to Buy a Vegetarian</a></strong></p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been trying to figure out how much it costs to save animals from factory farming.  The idea is to get people to become vegetarian by funding advertisements to influence them.  In <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">the previous essay</a>, I used a simple formula to work out the cost and it turned out to be a really cheap $0.02 to prevent a year of animal suffering on a factory farm (about $10 to get someone to become vegetarian for a year).</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/">built a calculator</a> so that anyone can play around with the formulas and be as pessimistic or optimistic as they like and see how that effects the calculations.</p>

<p>However, the simple calculation is… well… <em>simple</em>, and it needs some “beefing up”, no pun intended.  Therefore, I also built a “complex calculator” that works on a much more complex formula[1] that is hopefully correct[2] and will provide a more accurate estimation.  Here are the details…

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I start with the claim that it’s good for people to eat less meat, whether they become vegetarian – or, better yet, vegan – because this means less nonhuman animals are being <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/whyvegan/animals.html">painfully factory farmed</a>.  I’ve defended this claim previously in <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-eat-less-meat/">“Why Eat Less Meat?”</a>.</p>

<p>The second idea is that it shouldn’t matter <em>who</em> is eating less meat.  As long as less meat is being eaten, less animals will be farmed, and this is a good thing.  Therefore, we should try to get <em>other people</em> to also try and eat less meat.</p>

<p>The third idea is that it also doesn’t matter <em>who</em> is doing the convincing.  Therefore, instead of convincing our own friends and family, we can pay other people to convince people to eat less meat.  And this is exactly what organizations like <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/">Vegan Outreach</a> and <a href="http://www.thehumaneleague.com/">The Humane League</a> are doing.  With a certain amount of money, one can hire someone to distribute pamphlets to other people or put advertisements on the internet, and some percentage of people who receive the pamphlets or see the ads will go on to eat less meat.</p>

<p>But the fourth idea is the complication.  I want my philanthropic dollars to go as far as possible, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">so as to help as much as possible</a>.  Therefore, it becomes very important to try and figure out how much money it takes to get people to eat less meat, so I can compare this to other estimations and see what gets me the best “bang for my buck”.
