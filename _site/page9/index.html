    <p>Oh, hi there.  I didn’t see you.  Come on in.  The blog is back up and running.  Oh, that dust you see there?  I’ll have it cleaned off in just a little bit.  But, no, it’s ok.  Come on in and make yourself at home.</p>

<p>Me?  You want to know about me?  Well, ok.  Yes, the blog did take a little bit of a break as you may have noticed.  But I’ve been doing important things, don’t you worry.  Just last Saturday I took the LSAT (exam for law school admission) and the Saturday before that I took the GRE (exam for grad school admission) and I had to study for those exams rather than write for this blog.  I even sent in a job application.  What can I say?  I’m keeping my options open.</p>

<p>…I’ve also been doing a lot of work for my classes – it was midterm week.  But everything is accomplished now and I should have some time to return to the blog and write some cool things for you.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>I’ve been having a lot of conversations with various people about career choice.  Because I did not specifically ask most of the people I talked to about whether they wanted to have their thoughts published and because I thought the information was more useful in the aggregate anyway, I’ve mostly refrained from posting information about <em>individual</em> conversations I’ve had.  Instead, I’ve published a lot of aggregated advice in <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/i-now-have-approximately-five-career-categories/">“I Now Have Approximately Five Career Categories”</a>, which is built off of information from 26 different people.</p>

<p>However, I do think there is value in publishing individual conversations, something that is done by <a href="http://www.givewell.org/conversations">GiveWell</a> and <a href="http://www.nickbeckstead.com/conversations">Nick Beckstead</a>.  Therefore, when talking with Satvik Beri about my career choice, we both agreed it would be smart to publish our conversation.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There seems to be many important questions that need research, from the mundane (say, which of four slogans for 80,000 Hours people like best) to the interesting (say, how to convince people to donate more than they otherwise would).  Unfortunately, it’s difficult to collect data in a quick, reliable, and affordable way.  We generally lack access to easily survey-able populations and a lot of research has high barriers to entry for completing (such as needing to enroll in graduate school).</p>

<p>However, since the 2005 creation of <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon’s Mechanical Turk</a>, some of this has changed.  Mechanical Turk is a website where anyone can create tasks for people to complete at a certain wage.  These tasks can be anything, from identifying pictures to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-reliability-efficiencyaffordability-of-amazons-mechanical-turk/22994">transcribing interviews</a> to social science research.</p>

<p>Best of all, this is quick and cheap – for example, you could offer $0.25 to complete a short survey, put $75 in a pot, and get 300 responses within a day or two, and this should be quicker and cheaper than any other option available to you for collecting data.</p>

<p>But could Mechanical Turk actually be useable for answering important questions?  Could running studies on Mechanical Turk be a competitive use of altruistic funds?

    <p><em>Continuation of <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/i-now-have-approximately-five-career-categories/">“I Now Have Approximately Five Career Categories”</a>.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/i-now-have-approximately-five-career-categories/">Earlier</a>, I outlined approximately five things I’d consider as my post-college career: grad school, law school, market research, computer programming, and working directly for an effective altruist organization.</p>

<p>But which one should I pick?  I don’t actually know yet.  In the end, I can only pick one of the five to start with (though I probably could switch easily if I needed to.)  So I thought I would attempt to compare these careers across a few different categories, see what happens, and then outline some questions I still have and my next steps.

    <p><em>Continued from <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-plan/">“My Careers Plan”</a>.</em></p>

<p>As I continue the third week of the school year, I have 7 months and 29 days until I graduate and need a “Thing To Do After I Graduate”(TM) in order to qualify for “The Real World”(TM).  Earlier, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-plan/">I outlined a plan</a> to try and get a career that would lead me on a path “that will, taken as a whole, contribute the most to the world with regard to my utilitarian goals to increase total well-being”.</p>

<p>I recognize that my first career very likely won’t be my only career or even the place I spent all that much time at.  But it’s important that I have a “first step” or “five year plan” to figure out where I’m supposed to be pointed at in order to make this well-being maximization thing actually happen.</p>

<p>So where should I point?  I’ve narrowed it down to approximately five broad categories.  In no particular order, they are: law school, graduate school, computer programming, market research, or non-profit work.  I say “approximately” because these categories can be combined in some ways to make new opportunities.</p>

<p>Here’s the details.  Sorry it’s long, but it’s a complicated question and I have a lot of thoughts.  I really appreciate all those people who have taken the time to slog through this with me and give me valuable advice.
