  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over at Felicifia, Alonzo Fyfe, blogger at &lt;a href=&quot;http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Atheist Ethicist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://secularite.com/real-world-ethics-alonzo-fyfe/&quot;&gt;The Secularite&lt;/a&gt;, and I &lt;a href=&quot;http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=1024&quot;&gt;had a debate&lt;/a&gt; on “Which is a better theory of utilitarianism – Alonzo Fyfe’s desirism or Peter Hurford’s two-level utilitarianism?”.  I wanted to reprint that debate here.  Here’s the second entry (of eight).  This entry was written by me.  This is a continuiation of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/fyfe-hurford-debate-alonzo-round-one&quot;&gt;previous entry written by Alonzo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to first spend some of my precious word count mentioning how much of an honor it is to be engaging with Alonzo Fyfe on this important issue.  In many ways I owe Alonzo a lot for where I am today.  In 2011, I was a huge fan of desirism.  I learned many aspects of moral philosophy from reading Fyfe and became interested in ethics due to following Alonzo’s journey to figure out the right thing.  Perhaps ironically the first place I learned about the “two level utilitarianism” was from Fyfe himself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this debate, I offer “two-level utilitarianism” as a better view of utilitarianism.  However, I agree with Alonzo that this is more of a friendly discussion than a debate.  I must admit it might be hard for Alonzo to give up desirism after spending so much of his life defending it, just as it would be hard for me to give up utilitarianism after having a blog called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everydayutilitarian.com&quot;&gt;“The Everyday Utilitarian”&lt;/a&gt;.  But I rest assured that we are both beholden to the truth more than our particular brands of utilitarianism and believe we can be trusted to update our beliefs in the face of new arguments.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-two-level-utilitarianism&quot;&gt;What is “Two-Level Utilitarianism”?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1981, R. M Hare wrote a book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Thinking-Levels-Methods-Point/dp/0198246609&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral Thinking: It’s Levels, Method, and Point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which he defends preference utilitarianism in theory, but argues that the human condition requires two levels of utilitarianism in practice – an intuitive level of rule utilitarianism and a critical level of act utilitarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hare notes that throughout much of our life we operate at an intuitive level where we don’t have the time to think through a situation and we have to act on habit and internalized thinking.  At this intuitive level, we implement rule utilitarianism, where we internalize a set of rules and follow them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Hare argued that, as often as is possible, we should re-evaluate these rules for ourselves and engage in full and deliberate reflection.  At this critical level we implement act utilitarianism and perhaps resolve a particularly difficult moral problem and figure out ways to update our moral rules so that they better guide us to maximize utility in our intuitive moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-makes-one-utilitarianism-better-than-another&quot;&gt;What Makes One Utilitarianism Better Than Another?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this debate, we seek to find the “best” version of utilitarianism.  But, in doing so, we need some method to make judgments about what makes a theory of utilitarianism better than another.  Alonzo did not overtly outline any specific criteria, so I thought I would suggest one: if the best utilitarian act is the act that maximizes utility and the best utilitarian rule is the rule that maximizes utility, I suggest that the best version of utilitarianism is the version that maximizes utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This principle of meta-utilitarianism makes sense – utilitarianism should not be self-defeating when followed, so we therefore should adopt whatever theory actually accomplishes utilitarian ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-case-for-two-level-utilitarianism&quot;&gt;What is the Case for Two-Level Utilitarianism?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call “stereotypical act utilitarianism the naïve strawman theory of utilitarianism that we should, in practice, be straightforward utilitarians exactly as described in the textbook – from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep, we should analyze every option available to us and choose only that which maximizes utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many theorists have pointed out that stereotypical act utilitarianism doesn’t work because of problems like how difficult it is to calculate utility for everything and how we will often suffer from imperfect information.  Faced with these methodological and motivational problems to utilitarianism, I suggest we abandon stereotypical act utilitarianism in practice while keeping it in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/attention_and_effort/Attention_lo_quality.pdf&quot;&gt;Kahneman (1973)&lt;/a&gt; points out that we only have a finite amount of energy to allocate to each decision in our life.  Research in psychology has put forth “dual processing theory” where we have a “System I” style of thought that is quick, reflexive, and intuitive and a “System II” style of thought that is slow, reflective, and analytical.  This dual processing theory fits two-level utilitarianism perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’re realistic, we have to be comfortable with the fact that many of our decisions will be intuitive.  Indeed, making an intuitive snap decision without fully calculating out all the options will actually be the act utilitarian thing to do when we account for the fact that these calculations drain our energy and take time away from our ability to focus on other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that doesn’t mean we should stop there.  In fact, I think that while we shouldn’t strive to be act utilitarians at all times, the vast majority of people would become better at producing utility if they were more reflective and self-aware, not less.  When we have time to reflect, we can deliberately engage in “System II” processes (or operate at the critical level, as Hare calls it) and reflect upon our rules to sharpen them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divide provides us with the need for a two-level utilitarianism in order to fit it pragmatically.  It’s also this divide between situations that prevents rule utilitarianism from collapsing into act utilitarianism, which was a worry of Alonzo’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-makes-rules-better-than-desires&quot;&gt;What Makes Rules Better Than Desires?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desirism asks us to desire that which we have many and strong reasons to desire.  From a moral standpoint, this means adopting desires that help satisfy the desires of others.  However, it is far harder to alter your desires on a fundamental level than it is to maintain a desire to follow the best rules (out of a desire to be moral, perhaps) and then alter the rules you possess.  There’s also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=11191&quot;&gt;concern that desires do not exist&lt;/a&gt;, while rules certainly do exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, desirism does not elaborate on the role of reflection like two-level utilitarianism does.  What process are we engaging in when we decide what desires to adopt?  How do we change our own desires?  In answering these two questions, how is desirism different from rule utilitarianism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-utility--dont-know-but-not-intrinsic-value&quot;&gt;What is Utility?  Don’t Know, But Not Intrinsic Value.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where our moral systems seem to diverge is in attitudes toward utility.  Alonzo is fond of how desirism need only operate on desires and does not need any “intrinsic value” or “value-laden term”.  I agree with Alonzo in his critique of brain-state theories of value.  Personally, I have not yet found a satisfactory reduction of utility that is sufficiently rigorous and resolves moral dilemmas in a way that satisfies me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, for now, the utilitarian choices are pretty clear pragmatically without a robust theory of utility.  What’s important for the sake of this debate is that, like desirism, my version of two-level utilitarianism also does not rely on any “intrinsic value” or spooky stuff in order to work.  Instead, utility matters because people (and other beings capable of experience) matter, and these lives matter to me simply because I have a desire to make their lives better.  I consider myself to be a moral anti-realist and have therefore constructed an anti-realist version of utilitarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-ought-we-do-in-an-exotic-situation&quot;&gt;What Ought We Do in an Exotic Situation?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possible divergence is the “10000 Sadist Problem”.  Because this situation is so bizarre and unlike situations we encounter in everyday life, it’s likely that our normal rules and intuitions might fail to maximize utility.  Therefore, we should go to the critical level if time allows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I’d like to mention that the better utilitarian theory is the one that maximizes utility, not the one that gives the response to hypothetical scenarios that satisfies people’s intuitions.  This is what Luke Muelhauser calls &lt;a href=&quot;http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=523&quot;&gt;the wrong test for moral theories&lt;/a&gt;, precisely because we don’t have a reason to expect the correct moral answer to always be the intuitive one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I don’t think two-level utilitarianism would have you give up the kid to the 10000 sadists.  Many people think that utilitarianism suggests that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.  This isn’t precisely right, because utilitarianism also takes the strength of the need into account.  In this case, the need of the kid to avoid being tortured is intensely strong.  So strong, I’d suspect, that it still outweighs the satisfaction that the 10000 sadists get.  Generally, pain hurts a lot more than pleasure satisfies both in intensity and duration, and therefore can be expected to dominate in this calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;just-how-utilitarian-is-desirism-anyway&quot;&gt;Just How Utilitarian is Desirism, Anyway?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does Desirism Actually Maximize?&lt;/em&gt;
Alonzo suggests that desirism resolves the 10000 Sadists by suggesting we look at the desire to torture and ask if we need that desire.  Because we don’t possess reasons for a desire to torture, we can safely discard it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, who possesses the reasons for having or discarding desires?  The 10000 sadists themselves certainly have many reasons to keep their desire to torture – they get satisfaction from doing so.  The “10000 Sadists Problem” attacks utilitarianism’s maximization process, arguing (naïvely) that the utility gained by the 10000 sadists outweighs the utility lost by the tortured kid.  In order to discard the desire to torture, desirism must go against this grain of maximization and do something else.  I’m not sure what this process is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Does Desirism Not Count Future People?&lt;/em&gt;
Secondly, from a theoretical standpoint, I worry that desirism does not take desires into account that do not yet exist.  Perhaps Alonzo feels this is a feature and not a bug, and certainly “person-affecting” theories of utilitarianism are held among many theorists.  However, most utilitarian theories believe that future people matter just as much as present people, and we shouldn’t discriminate against them in our analysis just because they don’t yet exist.  I don’t know what Alonzo’s reasoning is for making this distinction into a morally relevant one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, while I don’t believe matching intuitions is important, this desire to help future people does match our intuitions – think of the desire to curb global warming or tackle large social challenges that will only benefit people several generations from now.  The very desire to leave a better Earth for future generations presupposes that future generations matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does Desirism Hear The Strongest Needs?&lt;/em&gt;
Lastly, from a pragmatic standpoint, I worry that desirism does not do a good enough job identifying which desires are the most numerous and most strong.  Right now, I believe one of the most pressing needs is extreme poverty in the developing world.  Two-level utilitarianism explicitly states we should evaluate needs objectively, and therefore brings extreme poverty to our attention.  However, the desires of these people to be free from extreme poverty don’t speak very loudly and don’t weigh much on the minds of us Americans.  When we Americans think of desires we have strong reasons to support, we think of those desires that speak to us loudly and end up supporting many first-world causes.  I think this is a utilitarian mistake and would hope the utilitarian theory we adopt guides people easily to this understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I offer two-level utilitarianism as the utilitarian theory that is better suited to maximize utility when implemented in practice.  I’ve argued in favor of two-level utilitarianism because it (a) fits with findings in psychology that we have two processing systems and limited attention to allocate to every event in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theory is more practical than desirism because (b) rules are more malleable than desires, (c) the role of reflection in desirism is less clear, (d) desires may not exist, and (e) two-level utilitarianism makes it clearer impartial attitudes matter when considering what problems ought to be prioritized morally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I’ve argued that desirism falls short of utilitarianism because it (f) has a strange attitude toward maximization and (g) does not take the welfare of future people into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I’ve answered Alonzo’s problem with utility by agreeing with him and arguing that two-level utilitarianism also only relies on entities that exist.  I also answered Alonzo’s 10000 Sadist Challenge by arguing that it is the wrong test for a moral theory.  And I answered Alonzo’s concern that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism by showing the impossibility of being act utilitarian all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/six-month-review-ii-june-november-2013/&quot;&gt;“Six Month Review II: June-November 2013”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, I’ve publicly published &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/a-year-of-mostly-new-years-resolutions/&quot;&gt;monthly reviews&lt;/a&gt; where I’ve reviewed progress on habits and published &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/six-month-review-ii-june-november-2013/&quot;&gt;six-month reviews&lt;/a&gt; where I’ve gone in-depth on personal life strategy.  While I still aim to review myself &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-i-am-productive/&quot;&gt;on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis&lt;/a&gt;, I am no longer going to publish these.  Instead, I’ve recently found that the monthly review is too quick to have meaningful things to say, while the six-month review is too slow.  Therefore, I’ve consolidated into a three-month review.  Here’s my personal review for the months of December, January, and February.  I’ve been delayed in getting this out due to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/behold-the-new-site&quot;&gt;site redesign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-my-path-to-impact&quot;&gt;What Is My Path to Impact?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it useful to start this review by stating my plans, and then seeing how well I did against these plans.  Broadly, I still self-identify as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/hx4/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/&quot;&gt;effective altruist&lt;/a&gt;, which means I want to do my best to make the world a better place.  But easier said than done!  How do I aim to do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;my-plan-broadly&quot;&gt;My Plan, Broadly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-im-giving-and-why/&quot;&gt;“Where I’m Giving and Why”&lt;/a&gt;, that there is “a huge priority to learn more about opportunities for doing good” and therefore “I’ve decided to spend my money and time trying to figure out how to learn more in reliable ways” (see also &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/&quot;&gt;me on unproven causes&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-ive-changed-my-mind-on-my-approach-to-speculative-causes/&quot;&gt;follow-up to that post&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.effective-altruism.com/paul-christiano-on-cause-prioritization-2/&quot;&gt;Paul Christiano on cause prioritization&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;long-term-the-three-year-plan&quot;&gt;Long-Term (The Three Year Plan)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-case-study-i-mostly-finished-choosing-between-careers/&quot;&gt;“My Case Study: I (Mostly) Finished Choosing Between Careers”&lt;/a&gt; that I’m currently aiming to be in “full-time employment for 40-60 hours a week, but then spending significant portion of my ‘free time’ volunteering and doing EA side projects”.  I will be starting work doing web development and statistics for a Chicago-based start-up on the 30th of June.  By splitting my time this way, I hope to learn a lot more about my earning potential, my ability to do EA projects, and how the value of these two things might compare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, over the next three years I’d like to take an opportunity to try work in several different spheres – &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/pitching-effective-altruism/&quot;&gt;marketing/outreach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/could-ea-community-building-be-an-easy-and-underfunded-win/&quot;&gt;community building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/for-impact-the-future-matters-more/&quot;&gt;cause prioritization research&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/organization-evaluation-template/&quot;&gt;strategic research&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/career-advice-for-jacy-choosing-between-ph-d-programs/&quot;&gt;coaching&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotimpact.im&quot;&gt;project management&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/sunday-links-4-earning-to-give/&quot;&gt;earning to give&lt;/a&gt; – and see where I am best suited to the EA movement.  Over the next three years (12 review cycles), I hope to have a strong preliminary determination about where I am most useful.  After that, I will either (1) continue to do the mixed model of earning to give and EA work, (2) focus solely on earning to give, or (3) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/&quot;&gt;retire early&lt;/a&gt; and focus solely on EA work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;short-term-the-three-month-plan&quot;&gt;Short-Term (The Three Month Plan)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next three months are March, April, and May.  After May is done, there will only be one month until I start my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main focus of my short-term plan will then be to focus on pre-professional prep.  This means learning a lot more statistics and programming.  I’d like to learn more back-end (Ruby on Rails, mainly), front-end (JavaScript, mainly), and Big Data stuff (R, Hadoop, MapReduce).  This should then put me in a strong position for my upcoming job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to support my longer-term plan.  I’d like to bring much greater organization to my projects in each sphere, for greater transparency and tracking.  Then, I’d like to try a little in each.  I’d like to arrange it so rather than trying everything at once, I do more things one-at-a-time to maintain higher focus (though I also think I thrive on having high variety in my tasks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-this-plan-and-not-others&quot;&gt;Why This Plan, and Not Others?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan seems best in a fairly obvious way.  Building programming strength seems like a great way to &lt;a href=&quot;http://80000hours.org/blog/238-how-to-assess-the-impact-of-a-career&quot;&gt;build career capital&lt;/a&gt; and increase my potential earnings a lot, and furthermore opens up other opportunities for volunteering or maybe even &lt;a href=&quot;http://80000hours.org/blog/256-should-more-altruists-consider-entrepreneurship&quot;&gt;creating a technology start-up&lt;/a&gt;.  Learning seems best from an EA point-of-view, since it will increase my impact over many years to come if I find better things to do, which I expect I will, and I might be able to influence others as well.  Such learning, considered as “cause prioritization”, is also listed by 80,000 Hours as &lt;a href=&quot;http://80000hours.org/blog/300-which-cause-is-most-effective--300&quot;&gt;the best cause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-i-spend-my-time&quot;&gt;How Did I Spend My Time?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;winter-break&quot;&gt;Winter Break&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 20 December to 19 January, I was at home, between semesters in college.  I had no concrete schedule and could largely do whatever I wanted.  I chose to break up my time as follows.  I intentionally focused a lot on socializing (seeing friends).  My other focus was on programming – getting through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby.railstutorial.org&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; – and on settting up &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotimpact.im&quot;&gt;.impact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that other includes things like showering, hygeine, prioritizing my work, travelling, packing/unpacking, visiting the dentist, getting a haircut, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Activity&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Hours Per Week&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Per Day&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;% of Day&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;% of Awake Day&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sleep&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;55.7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;8.0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;33%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Friends&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;40.8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;5.8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;24%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;36%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Other&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;24.1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3.4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Break&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;14.8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2.1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;9%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Programming&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;11.8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1.7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;7%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;.im&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;11.6&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1.7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;7%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Write&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;5%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Exercise&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4.4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.6&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ACE&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2.2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Senior Research&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1.9&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jan&quot;&gt;20-31 Jan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 20th of January, I returned for my final semester at college.  I added up Beta Theta Pi (my fraternity), Homework / Class, Denison Community Association (DCA), and Denison Venture Philanthropy (DVP) as timeblocks because they’re my school activities.  Time was broken up as follows.  I was heavily focused on Beta because I was in charge of coordinating recruitment for the Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition for working for ACE (0.58hrs/wk), projects included writing a play (2.03hrs/wk), volunteering for 80K (0.28hrs/wk), and doing EA-related research into career choice (0.58hrs/wk) and CFAR (1.02hrs/wk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Activity&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Hours Per Week&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Per Day&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;% of Day&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;% of Awake Day&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sleep&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;53.8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;7.7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;32%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Other&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;18.5&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2.7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Friends&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;18.4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2.6&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;HW/Class&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;13.7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2.0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;9%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Break&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;11.8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1.7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;7%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Programming&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;6.9&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ACE / Projects&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4.5&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Beta&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;22.9&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3.3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Senior Research&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1.6&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;.im&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;5.3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DCA&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;5.0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Write&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2.6&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Exercise&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2.2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DVP&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.04&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;february&quot;&gt;February&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I no longer had to work as much for Beta, I focused more on Programming and Senior Research.  I also began working on putting together a TEDx talk about strategic philanthropy.  Classes also ramped up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Activity&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Hours Per Week&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Per Day&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;% of Day&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;% of Awake Day&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sleep&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;53.4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;7.6&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;32%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Other&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;21.3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3.0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;HW/Class&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;18.3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2.6&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Friends&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;15.0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2.1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;9%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;.im&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;13.1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1.9&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;9%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Break&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;12.3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1.8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;7%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Programming&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;10.1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1.4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;9%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;TEDx&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;6.7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Beta&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;6.4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.9&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Senior Research&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4.9&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Exercise&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3.3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.5&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DCA&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2.8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DVP&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2.2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Write&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1.8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0.3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;is-my-time-properly-aligned-with-my-goals&quot;&gt;Is my time properly aligned with my goals?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My time is my most valuable resource, so I want to make sure that it’s working for me as best as is possible.  Broadly speaking, I do think the way I spend my time is properly aligned with my goals, with the exception of winter break.  On winter break, I probably spent a bit too much time sleeping and with friends – though this was probably acceptable given the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like it was probably a mistake to do senior research – while I do get some returns (social status, research experience, contact with professionals, potential publication), the returns do not seem worth the time investment, compared to other opportunities that I have.  However, at this point with a final draft already written and only one more month to go, it seems like it would be a mistake to drop it, even after taking into account the &lt;a href=&quot;http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/&quot;&gt;sunk cost fallacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seem to be doing the right things and my output also seems high.  I might be open to criticism from not having the right balance between my projects, but I don’t see any clear room for improvement.  I might also be open to critism from trying to do too much at once, but I don’t see any activities I can easily drop before graduation in May.  At this point in the middle of my final semester, I should just stay the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-i-accomplish&quot;&gt;What Did I Accomplish?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thinking-through-complex-issues&quot;&gt;Thinking Through Complex Issues&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What should I do when I graduate?”&lt;/strong&gt; I end up largely settling this question for myself in &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-case-study-i-mostly-finished-choosing-between-careers/&quot;&gt;“My Case Study: I (Mostly) Finished Choosing Between Careers”&lt;/a&gt;, where I settle on web development and announce that I will be starting a web development job this summer.  I also &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/second-interview-with-jon-behar-on-giving-games/&quot;&gt;interviewed Jon Behar a second time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/career-advice-for-jacy-choosing-between-ph-d-programs/&quot;&gt;give career advice to Jacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No progress on other questions.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite asking “What normative framework should I choose?”, “What would someone acting out utilitarianism in their everyday life look like?”, “How, if at all, can utilitarianism be presented as a robust moral theory?”, “What causes should a utilitarian focus on?”, “How, if at all, should I change my lifestyle?” and making goals to work further on these questions by the next review, I have not published progress on any of these questions, though I did think about the issues personally and have &lt;a href=&quot;http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=1024&quot;&gt;outlined many of my thoughts in an online debate with Alonzo Fyfe&lt;/a&gt;.  Publishing concrete progress on these questions will be a goal to accomplish by the next review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blogging-generally&quot;&gt;Blogging, Generally&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t write much during this three month period.  I decided that writing wasn’t as high impact at the moment as the other opportunities I was faced with (e.g., putting together the TEDx presentation, putting togehter .impact, and working on career development by learning programming).  I now intend to try to keep up writing again because I think that there are some high-value things for me to think through that would also be of interest to other people.  But I need to keep in mind that it’s still generally a better idea for me to focus on building up more important skills, like programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve aimed to begin a daily writing habit, and I hope to sustain that in small doses every day to keep my writing going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;animal-charity-evaluators&quot;&gt;Animal Charity Evaluators&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my previous list of goals, I had “volunteer for like-minded communities”.  Over the past three months, this was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/&quot;&gt;Animal Charity Evaluators&lt;/a&gt; (ACE), where I assisted in putting together their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/organization-evaluation-template/&quot;&gt;“Organization Evaluation Template”&lt;/a&gt;.  ACE is now beginning to make a round of research and recommendations based on this template.  I think this was a high-value project to influence the direction of ACE and I’m excited to see how it turns out.  Right now, it doesn’t seem like I will be doing additional volunteering for them, though I’m still open to the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impact&quot;&gt;.impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to volunteering with ACE, over the past three months, I spent a significant amoutn of my time helping start &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dotimpact.im/&quot;&gt;.impact&lt;/a&gt;, “a distributed volunteer force of effective altruists working on really useful projects”.  This involved work on four projects – &lt;a href=&quot;https://impact.hackpad.com/.meta-e1HVjGcw27B&quot;&gt;.meta&lt;/a&gt;, or work on organizing .impact as a whole; &lt;a href=&quot;https://impact.hackpad.com/Studying-Vegetarian-Advocacy-m11aW51ENVW&quot;&gt;a study of the impact of Facebook ads on vegetarians&lt;/a&gt;; creating &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/smartgiving&quot;&gt;r/smartgiving&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://impact.hackpad.com/EA-Reddit-CgvrZdkwXWV&quot;&gt;Reddit for EA&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://impact.hackpad.com/Job-Board-G2ZocnkVTsc&quot;&gt;the Job Board&lt;/a&gt;, which has mostly just been an outlet to learn programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think there has been a decent amount of value from these projects and .impact as a whole, with a lot of potential and learning value yet to be realized.  A more detailed review of .impact is forthcoming shortly.  I intend to continue work in .impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tedx&quot;&gt;TEDx&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another opportunity I had was to participate in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/9579&quot;&gt;TEDxDenisonU&lt;/a&gt;, which was a TEDx talk featuring 12 different speeches from Denison students, Denison faculty, and the wider Denison community.  This seemed like a great opportunity to share a message of strategic philanthropy, and I took it, talking about GiveWell and SCI.  I also took the opportunity to practice honing my pitch.  I hope to share more on this when the YouTube version of the talk is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;learning-programming&quot;&gt;Learning Programming&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned a significant amount of programming over the past three months, having put in a combined 110 hours into learning.  I’ve completed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis&quot;&gt;Coursera “Data Analysis” class&lt;/a&gt; which brought me up to intermediate level knowledge of the statistical language R (~45 hours to complete) and I completed &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book&quot;&gt;Michael Hartl’s Ruby on Rails tutorial&lt;/a&gt; (~40 hours).  Both of these tutorials are highly recommended.  I also worked on the Job Board to further learn Ruby on Rails; enrolled in a Computer Science course at Denison focused on Python, C++, and data structures / algorithms; and am working through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaggle.com&quot;&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://adv-r.had.co.nz&quot;&gt;“Advanced R”&lt;/a&gt; to learn more R techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, I hope to soon start working through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Development-Rails-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356549&quot;&gt;“Agile Web Development with Rails”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/&quot;&gt;“Javascript is Sexy”&lt;/a&gt; to learn more Ruby/Rails and JavaScript respectively.  I hope to write up more on my experiences learning programming, as well as collaborate with some other programmers to create a guide to help other people learn programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-and-talking-to-cool-people&quot;&gt;Finding and Talking to Cool People&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still continue to be very excited about my level of connecting with the people in my life.  I’ve worked a bit more on acheiving some work-life balance with regard to this.  I’ve now &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotimpact.im/meetings.html&quot;&gt;Skyped with many people for .impact&lt;/a&gt; and personally, as well as correspondend with people via other mediums.  I’ve also worked harder to connect with other friends in my life, including my Beta brothers and my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-denison-university-a-better-place&quot;&gt;Making Denison University a Better Place&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/six-month-review-ii-june-november-2013/&quot;&gt;My previous review&lt;/a&gt; made a point of trying to scale down my involvement in on-campus activities.  Ultimately, over the past three months I have succeeded in scaling down my involvement, but not as much or as quickly as I might like.  I intend to continue to try to scale down and transition my involvement in all Denison acitvities as I prepare to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eating-and-exercise&quot;&gt;Eating and Exercise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My exercise has not been conformed to the “three days lifting, two days running” as often as I’d like.   I need to renew my focus here, especially with regard to running, which has been hard to motivate myself to do given the very cold winter.  However, while my running has backslid over the past three months (I’m no longer as good of a runner as I once was), I have increased my lifts – Squat +25lbs (190 to 215lbs), Benchpress +25lbs (85 to 110lbs), Deadlift +50lbs (215 to 265lbs), and Overhead Press +15lbs (70 to 85lbs).  (I did not increase on my Rows, but that’s because my range of motion in my initial row form was wrong, leading me to have larger weights than merited.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the eating front, things have also become less consistent.  I have been able to mostly keep up a healthy diet, though I have had a lot of struggles with eating junk food that I need to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’m telling myself to keep up the good work.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some people have committed a great deal of their lives to trying to best make the world a better place. I’m trying to sit down with some of these people and learn more about their thoughts and motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I sit down with Ryan Carey, who has spent a lot of time working on various projects to make the world a better place, from setting up the utilitarian forum, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.felicifia.org/&quot;&gt;Felicifia&lt;/a&gt;, to co-creating an “effective altruist” meetup group in Melbourne, Australia.  He is now currently working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leverageresearch.org/&quot;&gt;Leverage Research&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/&quot;&gt;Centre for Effective Altruism&lt;/a&gt; on research into the far future and associated risks.  Ryan has recently been blogging about his thoughts and experiences on &lt;a href=&quot;http://careyryan.com/&quot;&gt;his personal blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hi Ryan, good to talk to you. Let’s start off with your origin story. How did you first get interested in effective altruism?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah, I learnt about effective altruism through the idea of utilitarianism. I had been reading philosophers like Daniel Dennett, and neuroscientists like VS Ramachandran.  I wanted to know about big questions relating to consciousness and ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in high-school, and I had mentioned to my mother some of the things that I had been reading, and it came to her mind that there was an old professor who had once taught her some lessons in bioethics and she had a book for me by that author… That book was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Ethics-Peter-Singer/dp/0521707684&quot;&gt;Practical Ethics&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Singer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read his ideas about animals, poverty, and ethics in general, it just clicked for me - he seemed so reasonable and rational.  I went on to learn about this philosophy and gather others who shared that interest online. Many years later when the effective altruist and rationality movements developed, that just crystallized my thinking about how to make the world better and drove me to take more concrete actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cool!  I was influenced from utilitarianism to effective altruism myself.  But I know a lot of other utilitarians who aren’t effective altruists and just are content to speculate and philosophize without doing anything.  It frustrates me.  What do you think compelled you made this jump to action?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; If only I knew – then we could just swing by all of the utilitarians and activate them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I know is that knowing that suffering is bad, or that you would like people’s experienced to be improved, is very far from feeling empowered to do something about it.  I’d speculate that there are personality factors involved - some people are naturally conscientious. A cynic might say naturally compelled by guilt, although that’s not my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, every time I’ve been involved with other people who are motivated, then I become socially engaged with that group, and it drives me to do more things that I think that they will find exciting and impressive. So I’ve passed through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.felicifia.org&quot;&gt;Felicifia&lt;/a&gt;, my utilitarian forum, and then into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lesswrong.com&quot;&gt;LessWrong&lt;/a&gt;, and through the effective altruist community as well, and at every step I’ve found a lot of people who I like and enjoy being around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would certainly be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.overcomingbias.com/&quot;&gt;the Hansonian explanation&lt;/a&gt; - that charity is not about doing good, it’s about getting social points. And I guess my experience is pretty consistent with the idea that social points have played a factor at driving me to do more every step of the way.  But I’ve just been lucky in that the people I surround myself with and respect tend to care very much about productivity. So I get social points by starting projects that have a large expected impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I guess Robin would agree that we can signal an expectation of effectiveness from others - I’ve mostly been activated by enjoying the company of other EAs - social signalling used for good, and I think there should be more of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A brutally honest and self-aware answer, as much as I’d like to hope there’s more to EA than runaway signalling!  Even so, do you think there’s a way we could harness this desire for social points to get more people to want to do good?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, well I think it already happens, and it’s really good. I think that effective altruist groups are popping up all over the world.  Some of them are branded by EA in general, like my new group in Melbourne, but most of them are broadly under the umbrellas of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.givingwhatwecan.org&quot;&gt;Giving What We Can&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.80000hours.org&quot;&gt;80,000 Hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think these groups deliver a lot of value to attendees, people learn a lot of fascinating ideas and get to build really close social relationships.  But at the same time, these groups challenge people to integrate a lot of challenging ideas into their behaviour, like the idea of earning to give and the idea that researching the future is important and neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think of LessWrong as an effective altruist group too. It’s nominally a group for rationality, but almost everyone is altruistic when you get down far enough. LessWrong shares EAs’ affinity for the scientific method and for evaluating consequences.  In turn, EAs frequently share LW-esque views about biases and epistemology.  They’re sister groups in Melbourne, and I think everywhere, so I think all of these communities are tremendously important for encouraging people to do good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It’s certainly cool that you’ve got to be a part of the effective altruism wave with &lt;a href=&quot;http://careyryan.com/end-of-year-review-of-effective-altruism-melbourne/&quot;&gt;EA Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.  But that’s a pretty big initiative.  How did EA Melbourne get it’s start?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; It started when we were contacted by Giving What We Can Central.  I was notified that Rangi de Silva was in Melbourne - another doctor in training who was interested in starting a group there.  So I contacted absolutely everyone I could think of - the central coordinators of Giving What We Can, 80,000 Hours, THINK, Leverage Research, everyone I knew from the Monash University’s philosophy society, and from the local LessWrong group, as well as some old friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of us met in a coffee shop to decide what we wanted to do and the very first social event was well attended right away, which was excellent.  I’m glad to see that they’ve continued to go from strength to strength after I’ve left and my co-collaborator Brayden stepped down, by hosting CFAR, who spoke to an audience of 70.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes regular, reliable timely work to coordinate things and a network who will attend, I think those are the main things.  That’s what I would suggest to someone trying to launch an EA group, and it’s glad to see that EA Melbourne certainly still has those going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Do you think anything else made EA Melbourne a success, or was it just sheer hard work?  What would be some tips you might give to people who want to organize EA groups in their own local communities?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that the amount of work required is pretty patchy. You can’t just disappear from the planet and spend two months without organizing anything. In particular, you need to be present to arrange things on a weekly basis at the start.  But it’s mostly just basic logistics like setting a venue, a topic, and maybe a speaker, and inviting people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just need to make sure that you give people a reason to come, they need to know somebody who will be there, and the group need to be nice people - as of course most EAs are - and they need to have something interesting to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start a group, I recommend contacting the central EA groups to get them to introduce you to anyone interested who lives locally and gathering a few people who are willing to throw their social networks into the project.  The Central EA groups can offer a little support remotely, but mostly having a kind, sociable and gender-balanced seed-group seems to often lead to a virtuous cycle that grows itself.  It just takes strong existing social networks and a couple of months of good events to bootstrap that.  I’ve elaborated on these tips in &lt;a href=&quot;http://careyryan.com/ten-simple-tricks-to-meet-effective-altruists-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next/&quot;&gt;an article on my blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;That’s great advice.  Thanks!  But you’ve moved on from EA Melbourne.  What lead you to give all that up?  What are you doing now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; The thing with EA groups is that people always ask you questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the purpose of this group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can I volunteer for you or others?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who should I donate to?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the most important work to do, apart from recruitment. i.e. we can build social networks for so long, but what should we do afterwards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions are interesting, important and complex. So I set out to develop better answers to these questions. I feel that the answers lie in the area of improving the far future. However, it’s very unclear what we can do to best prepare society to flourish in even 10 or 100 years from now and so I decided that I had to find out an answer to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best plan for doing this was to travel to the hubs of EA and rationality to get up to speed on others’ progress. I’ve begun 2013 by being in San Francisco where I have collaborated with The Center for Applied Rationality and Leverage Research and I will do a similar thing in Oxford later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the way the goal is to learn how to produce a better future, including a major subquestion: what kind of people we need to do that work? I am currently doing some research on some of those questions while also trying to build a movement of people to help. I’ll probably be split evenly between research and movement-building over the coming six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, EA Melbourne was a valuable project but now I’m running out of new ideas to share with them and I think I need to meet experts who have thought about things for longer in greater detail to keep learning. Also during the time when I was doing EA Melbourne I was working as a doctor there and now that I have finished my internship year I have the option to take on other responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What made you think that producing a better future is more important than, say, working on global poverty or nonhuman animal rights?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; The best version that I have heard of the argument is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GctnYAYcMhI&quot;&gt;a lecture by Max Tegmark at an old Singularity Summit&lt;/a&gt;. His idea is that future is so vast, in terms of time and space, and yet its value comes from the fact that we are here to see it. Now we can determine whether our civilization will grow across the universe or conversely whether nothing interesting happens again anywhere ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I value the lives of people in a civilization a million years from now the same as lives of people now, so it seems so much worse if we muck things up cosmically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it’s grandiose to want to save the world, it is egotistical to think that everything important is going to happen in one time and space, when we live in a universe that is so much larger - to think that our current experiences are the best that the universe has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How exactly to secure our future, and ensure that everyone has better lives, including non-human animals is a very complex question, but i think that it is also the most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What do you think of the current work being done on this topic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that &lt;a href=&quot;http://yudkowsky.net/&quot;&gt;Eliezer Yudkowsky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nickbostrom.com/&quot;&gt;Nick Bostrom&lt;/a&gt; have done the most in performing and popularizing this research.  I think they have robust arguments that artificial intelligence poses the largest extinction risk over the next century. Consider that one by one, computers have basically taken on tasks that are more impressive and complicated like chess, go, jeopardy and now driving.  The extent to which we are using computers, the diversity of jobs for which we turn to them in our day to day lives has greatly increased over the last decade. Our computers are networked much more closely and we spend much more time with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If computers continue to get more intelligent in slightly more abstract ways year upon year for another few decades, the world will already look very strange to humans today.  If these systems take on ever more of the properties of autonomy and goal-directedness of high-frequency trading systems and military robots, then we can envisage machines overtaking the intelligence of humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reached such a situation, it very quickly becomes important that the robots are embedded with some kind of ethics or human values and I think the folks at MIRI have good arguments that we can expect computing to be increasingly goal-directed, that this could happen quickly, and that it would take some extreme kind of precision to create a machine intelligence with values that create a happy outcome for humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is one issue that plays a big part in many people’s models of the future, and I think it’s an important one.  However it’s only one issue.  There are a range of other global catastrophic risks including asteroids, supervolcanoes, bioterrorism, and nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holden has recently argued that we should consider our developmental trajectory as a civilisation to be anomalous by historical standards and that any of a number of global catastrophic risks could cause civilisation to take humanity off its favourable developmental trajectory.  I agree with him that research on Global Catastrophic Risks in general is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also advocates that a bunch of strategies like alleviating poverty can have positive flow-through effects that will set our civilisation on a better long-run trajectory and I think that there are lots of conceivable interventions that Nick Beckstead would describe as broad-based including improving collaboration and rationality, that could conceivably make things go a lot better in the long run.  We could also enhance human intelligence or human morality.  There are almost endless possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, I find the narrower research on global catastrophic risks and artificial intelligence has the most compelling case for improving the far future, but I’m not sure if I have good reasons for that and I think that the field could easily be broken wide-open by an academic is informed and able to think more clearly about these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Do you think you could be that kind of informed academic who breaks the field open?  If not, what do you expect to do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; I doubt I can outdo all of Eliezer, Paul Christiano, Carl Shulman and all of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;FHI&lt;/a&gt;.  But I hope that I can understand the field enough to know what kind of people are required, what kind of infrastructure can be provided to support their work, to publicise it and to reach out to gifted young people who might be interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Do you have specific plans of action yet?  Or are you still thinking?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; Both! And I think I always plan to be!  Actually, mostly the second one, because my plans mostly involve gathering more people together to help me think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MY two projects are &lt;a href=&quot;https://impact.hackpad.com/EA-Blog-Compilation-Introduction-B87PSZopY4f&quot;&gt;an EA Handbook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://impact.hackpad.com/Effective-Altruist-Community-Blog-using-LW-Codebase-lGglK2kN3Ll&quot;&gt;an Online Community called The Most Good&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EA Handbook is a document that will introduce people to effective altruism and bring them up to speed on these questions. I’m preparing this with Will MacAskill. So far, we have collected many existing essays and a few authors have agreed to write some more to describe how everybody can contribute to existing organisations. This project should be finished by the middle of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online community The Most Good will provide a central location for EA blog posts, discussion and meetups.  To avoid duplicating work, we’re using &lt;a href=&quot;http://trikeapps.com/&quot;&gt;Trike Apps&lt;/a&gt;, who will build the software using the LessWrong codebase. This website is currently in the design stage, but hopefully it will be completed by mid-year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; _If you don’t mind me asking, why are you doing all this yourself?  Earlier you said you were training to be a doctor.  I’ll bet on a doctor’s salary you could “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.effective-altruism.com/what-earning-give-0/&quot;&gt;earn to give&lt;/a&gt;” and hire multiple people to work on these projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; I might end up going back to being a doctor, but there are three reasons that I’m not doing that right now: (1) I don’t know who to fund, (2) I think that many of these future-oriented projects are more time than money constrained, and (3) my uncertainties around my skill and fit are greater for research and activism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On (1), in global poverty reduction, we think that charities vary in up to 100x effectiveness.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cser.org/&quot;&gt;Center for the Study of Existential Risk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intelligence.org&quot;&gt;Machine Intelligence Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, FHI, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gcrinstitute.org/&quot;&gt;Global Catostrophic Risk Institute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org&quot;&gt;Centre for Effective Altruism&lt;/a&gt; are all working on issues relating to the far future, and I currently have very little idea which is the most effective. In research in particular, we know that some like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug&quot;&gt;Norman Borlaug&lt;/a&gt; can be enormously effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, in terms of citations, we know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://80000hours.org/blog/65-should-you-go-into-research-part-1&quot;&gt;some researchers outperform others by many orders of magnitude&lt;/a&gt;. In future-oriented research in particular, this seems to remain the case. Some futurists clearly have very poor intellectual methodologies and so I expect that in future-oriented research, I think this should remain the case. Moreover, there are no good metrics for the impact of future-oriented research. Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky are not merely aiming for publications and citations, and neither should they be. So these can only be a small part of my assessment. I can ask experts that I respect whose research they value the most, and I think that this is an important part of the solution, but it is also somewhat circular. It is hard to decide who to respect without any technical understanding, and this can be biased by halo effects that come from their attractiveness, demeanor or social competence. So I think at this stage, I need greater technical understanding in order to decide who to give to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On (2), I think that many of these future-oriented projects are more time than money constrained. I know less than a hundred people who are interested and able to perform research into the far future and build a surrounding movement. By contrast, I know several people who have demonstrated their willingness to support ambitious research agendas, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel&quot;&gt;Peter Thiel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaan_Tallinn&quot;&gt;Jaan Tallin&lt;/a&gt;, Matt Wage and Matt Fallshaw. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One has to ask what we know that Peter Thiel doesn’t that is preventing him from giving all his funding to the MIRI or Jaan to the CSER. I think they know that their ability to turn cash into recruiting and employing valuable researchers is limited, or at least the marginal returns will decline at some point. Another line of reasoning is that many people are currently pursuing earn-to-give careers in finance and entrepreneurship that will take 3-10 years to pay off, and so it should soon become easier to get effective projects funded. Also most thought-leaders and organization-leaders who I have talked to consider that their organizations are more constrained by talent that funding. Of course, these statements are misleading or false if taken as absolutes. They make sense only when one talks about how much funding weighed against how much talent or recruitment ability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On (3), given this information about the wide range of usefulness of far-future oriented research, I am highly uncertain about my impact there. I am also pretty uncertain about my value as an entrepreneur, but less so. Medicine is by far the most reliable option. Currently, it seems best to narrow my uncertainty on my impact as a researcher or in performing recruitment and movement-building. Then, I might move on to start-ups. If all this falls through, then I’ll happily be a doctor and pool my funding with the rest. Although even then it seems good to live in or visit the EA hubs to stay motivated and inform my donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;How were you able to quickly integrate yourself with the San Francisco and Oxford EA communities in order to get involved?  What could an aspiring EA do to follow in your footsteps and also work on making a better future?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; Professionally, I think EAs and rationalists can easily see your value if you are conscientious or have achieved some broad competencies. I recommend asking to be introduced to some of the leaders of these organizations by your best connected EA friends or cold-emailing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socially, I think EAs and wonderful and inclusive people. If you have some social skills, or even if you don’t have many social skills, but you have interesting ideas, people will tend to like you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice regarding integrating into the San Francisco and Oxford communities would be - just do it - I think that travelling to Oxford and San Francisco’s Bay Area are key steps in my intellectual development. Interning at the Center for Applied Rationality or the Center for Effective Altruism are good steps.  Or, one can attend a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rationality.org/&quot;&gt;CFAR workshop&lt;/a&gt; or get career counselling from 80,000 Hours.  And I am always happy to be contacted to answer questions and help with introductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What is a typical day for you like these days?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; Every day I read about topics that I think might improve my strategic understanding.  I try to research techniques recommended by people I respect. Recently I’ve been researching intelligence - I take creatine every day and measure its effect with a 20 minute battery of cognitive tests.  For the last fortnight I have been practising speed-reading, because I think that it is important to front-load the acquisition of skills that will help further productivity and research. I am doing emails to prepare the handbook. I discuss with researchers at Leverage and the Center for Applied Rationality regarding to how we can be smarter, more emotionally stable, and less biased. When I learn something new or useful, I write it down on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these professional jobs, I’m most confident in the importance of speed-reading, movement-building, and researching creatine. My ongoing plan is contingent on what works and I expect I’ll answer very differently two months from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of EA, I like to see blues, funk and soul music, and comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What do you think is the most important thing you’re not doing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; Probably what &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Gaverick_Matheny&quot;&gt;Gaverick Matheny&lt;/a&gt; is doing.  He is the project manager at IARPA responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iarpa.gov/Programs/ia/ACE/ace.html&quot;&gt;the Aggregative Contingent Estimation program&lt;/a&gt; in which the good judgement project are competing and aggregating opinions to improve probabilistic forecasts of real events. I think that improving collective prediction and collective decision-making is important for stability and cooperation between governments and that it’s important to improve the sanity level of populations and large govenrments, and this work seems like a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well, I think I’m out of questions.  It was great getting a chance to talk with you and learn more about you.  Do you have anything else you want to pass on to EAs before we leave?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; I would say congrats on being one of the special few who is keen to change the world. By meeting others in your hometown and in EA hubs, you can learn faster and become more productive. Try to learn about the questions that expert EAs are asking themselves, and think about how you might fit in. EA is in a fascinating sociological and intellectual position, and I hope there are great things to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks for the interview Peter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Anytime.  It was great to hear more about you and I look forward to talking with you again sometime!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important to keep things fresh.  It seems like at least once a year or so, I change what the site looks like.  This year, server problems, financial costs, and other bloat inspired me to move away from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordpress.org&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; and paid hosting on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dreamhost.com&quot;&gt;Dreamhost&lt;/a&gt; to the wonderful land of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll static blog&lt;/a&gt; hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt;.  Back five years ago when I first signed on with Dreamhost, none of these tools existed.  Now, it’s time that I finally adopt them.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I still do these…  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/14/the-virtue-of-silence/&quot;&gt;“The Virtue of Silence”&lt;/a&gt;: “Leah Libresco writes a couple of essays on an ethical dilemma reported in the New York Times. In the course of a confidential medical history, a doctor hears her patient is suffering from stress-related complaints after having sent an innocent man to prison. The doctor wants to know whether it is ethical to report the matter to the police. The Times’ columnist says yes – it would save the poor prisoner. Leah says no – violating medical confidentiality creates an expectation that medical confidentiality will be violated in the future, thus dooming patients who are too afraid to talk about drug use or gay sex or other potentially embarrassing but important medical risk factors.  But both sides are ignoring the much bigger dilemma lurking one meta-level up: is it ethical to debate this dilemma in the New York Times?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utilitarian-essays.com/robustness-against-uncertainty.html&quot;&gt;Charity Cost-Effectiveness in an Uncertain World&lt;/a&gt;: “Evaluating the effectiveness of our actions, or even just whether they’re positive or negative by our values, is very difficult. One approach is to focus on clear, quantifiable metrics and assume that the larger, indirect considerations just kind of work out. Another way to deal with uncertainty is to focus on actions that seem likely to have generally positive effects across many scenarios, and often this approach amounts to meta-level activities like encouraging positive-sum institutions, philosophical inquiry, and effective altruism in general. When we consider flow-through effects of our actions, the seemingly vast gaps in cost-effectiveness among charities are humbled to more modest differences, and we begin to find more worth in the diversity of activities that different people are pursuing. Those who have abnormal values may be more wary of a general “promote wisdom” approach to shaping the future, but it seems plausible that all value systems will ultimately benefit in expectation from a more cooperative and reflective future populace.”
&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whynojobs&quot;&gt;“The Reason So Many People are Unemployed”&lt;/a&gt;: “A good way to wrap your head around this is to think about a much smaller case: instead of the whole economy, let’s think about a now-famous babysitting co-op on Capitol Hill. Instead of dollars, the co-op used its own scrip that was worth an hour of babysitting time. When you wanted to go out, you’d pay a couple hours to someone else to watch your kids; then when they wanted to go out, they’d pay you or someone else to do the same for them.  It all worked great for a while, until one day they found they had too few pieces of scrip. Every couple had only a couple hours left and, having so little, they didn’t want to waste it. So they all decided to save it for a very special occasion. This was kind of an incredible situation — even though there were people who wanted someone to babysit their kids, and people who were willing to do just that, the deal didn’t happen, simply because the co-op hadn’t printed enough colored pieces of paper. Eventually the co-op learned their mistake, printed some more scrip and handed it out, and everybody went back to babysitting like before and were much happier for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spring.org.uk/2013/02/the-single-most-effective-method-for-influencing-people-fast.php&quot;&gt;The Single Most Effective Method for Influencing People Fast&lt;/a&gt;: “Influence techniques vary considerably in how effective, ethical and easy to perform they are. At the easy, more ethical end of the spectrum, is affirming someone’s right to choose. This is a benign strategy which happens to have the handy side-effect of increasing persuasion.  But what if you are looking to use a little more effort to get a lot more persuasion-power? Then perhaps the disrupt-then-reframe (DTR) technique is for you.  A word of warning, though: the DTR technique is more of a cheap (but very effective) trick which some might find morally questionable. OK, with the health warning over, here’s what they did in the original study which kicked off this whole line of research.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/02/cognitive-democracy-condorcet-with-competence.html&quot;&gt;Cognitive Democracy: Condorcet with Competence&lt;/a&gt;: “We usually think of democracy as a way of aggregating diverse preferences but we can also imagine that we share similar preferences and that what we disagree about is the best way to achieve those preferences. From this perspective, democracy can be thought of as a tool for information aggregation. Using simple probability theory, Condorcet showed in 1785 that even when each individual voter has only a slightly better than chance probability of choosing the bettier of two options the probability that majority rule chooses the better outcome quickly goes to 1 as the number of voters increases (the wisdom of the crowds).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/iro/systematic_lucky_breaks/&quot;&gt;Systematic Lucky Breaks:&lt;/a&gt; “Many people can point to significant events that improved their lives in a positive way. They often refer to these as ‘lucky breaks’, and take it for granted that such events are rare. But most of the time ‘lucky breaks’ don’t need to be uncommon-you can often reverse engineer the reasons behind them and cause them to happen more frequently. So when a one-off event ends up contributing a lot of value, you should systematically make it part of your life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/do-unpaid-internships-lead-to-jobs-not-for-college-students/276959/&quot;&gt;“Do Unpaid Internships Lead to Jobs? Not for College Students”&lt;/a&gt;: “The common defense of the unpaid internship is that, even if the role doesn’t exactly pay, it will pay off eventually in the form of a job. Turns out, the data suggests that defense is wrong, at least when it comes to college students.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid all the focus on how much it costs precisely to save a life, here’s a good reminder from GiveWell that &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/11/the-moral-case-for-giving-doesnt-rely-on-questionable-quantitative-estimates/&quot;&gt;the moral case for giving doesn’t rely on questionable quantitative estimates”&lt;/a&gt;: “To us, the strongest form of the challenge is not ‘How much should I give when $X saves a life?’ but ‘How much should I give, knowing that I have massive wealth compared to the global poor?’”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the past, some people have suggested that we “gamify” effective altruism some more, and create points for doing altruistic-y things, like donating our money or volunteering our time.  I think this could be a good idea, but rather than seeing individual scores, I’d much rather see a collective team score for EA.  We’d compete as a group to beat our past group selves (make March better than February, for example) rather than compete amongst ourselves as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several problems with the individual competition model, but the biggest problem is the most fundamental – &lt;strong&gt;effective altruism is not&lt;/strong&gt; (and shouldn’t be) &lt;strong&gt;a competition.&lt;/strong&gt;  Rather, we are a team.  A community.  We all have one common goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some effective altruists who see EAs like Holden Karnofsky or what not do incredible things, and feel a little bit of resentment at themselves and others; feeling inadequate that they can’t make such a large difference.  This is an important feeling for generating a desire to improve, and keeping a &lt;a href=&quot;http://michaelgr.com/2007/04/15/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset-which-one-are-you/&quot;&gt;growth mindset&lt;/a&gt; in the face of this could lead to great things for you.  However, it’s even more important not to let this get you into depression, &lt;strong&gt;simply because Holden’s success is also your success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All effective altruists care about is making sure that the world is a better place.  It doesn’t matter who is doing the better-ing.  If Holden, Bill Gates, and Dustin Moskovitz each have 1 billion EA points and you only have five, you should be celebrating the fact that the EA community is collectively at 3 billion and five EA points and that you’re helping.  You shouldn’t feel bad that you’re not doing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have different skills and abilities.  Growth mindset does say that we each have an ability to be incredibly effective and altruistic, but we still all start with different places.  It’s simply not the case that all of us, right this year, could be making seven figure donations to GiveWell or be putting in 80 hours a week at a top non-profit.  But we all can do our best and try a little harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start seeing ourselves more as a community where everyone has something to offer and celebrate our collective success, not despair over who is or is not the most effective.  Effective altruism shouldn’t be a competition (at least, among individuals).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Idea adapted from Brian Tomasik’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;amp;t=797&quot;&gt;“Teamwork over Envy”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jacy is an effective altruist trying to decide what career to go into after college.  He’s currently choosing between a Ph.D. in neuroscience or a Ph.D. in economics.  He wrote to me asking for advice.  This was my reply.  We both agreed it would be good to publish it so that others thinking about Ph.D. programs can benefit as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made you wait a long time for not too much, because I don’t know a lot about PhD programs.  So I’ll be saying more general things that are less helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, I’m skeptical of PhD programs because they tend to really restrict your options (committing you to a path for several years), which seems bad early on when you’re just learning about what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My intuition is that a PhD is a pretty poor path toward earning a lot of money, because the earnings are not a guarantee and they are in the more distant future, requiring discounting for both time and probability.  An economics PhD might be an exception for opening up superior finance careers, but I suspect that if you have the talent to do well in finance, you’d have that talent immediately and could go in straight away.  That’s just a guess though.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, this time distance and the option-closing inflexibility seems especially bad when you consider the fact that (luckily) it seems EA is heading long-term toward having more money than talent.  Thus, it seems best to me (right now, based on what I know), for really dedicated EAs to head toward doing more direct work than earning to give.  So not only do I think PhDs are an inferior path to earning to give, I think earning to give might be an inferior path altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in my opinion, what you’re really comparing PhDs on is the “valuable academic research” route.  This way, getting a PhD could be valuable direct work.  Here, my intuitions lean to economics PhD over neuroscience for a variety of reasons: (1) economics seems more relevant to policy and thus more likely to make changes that lead to impact, (2) economists seem more credible as influencers generally, and (3) economists get to focus specifically on the developing world over the developed world where needs seem less strong.  (Also, weighted in the favor of economics is the non-direct impact stuff.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you’ve been thinking through this a lot and have been having a hard time choosing between many different choices.  My guess is that if you’re not &amp;gt;95% committed to an economics PhD for reasons both including effective altruism and including non-EA stuff like personal satisfaction / enjoyment / etc., you should hold off and do something that keeps your options open.  Learn more about what direct work you could do or what your earnings in finance et. al. could be (perhaps by trying these things for a year each or something), and then make a decision based off that.  You’ll be in a much better position to make an informed choice after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, you might find it useful to reflect on your open options with criteria on paper, like I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-case-study-i-mostly-finished-choosing-between-careers/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Then publish it for people to review and critique.  This was the single most helpful thing I did for myself, but I understand it’s not how everyone thinks through things best.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over at Felicifia, Alonzo Fyfe, blogger at &lt;a href=&quot;http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Atheist Ethicist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://secularite.com/real-world-ethics-alonzo-fyfe/&quot;&gt;The Secularite&lt;/a&gt;, and I &lt;a href=&quot;http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=1024&quot;&gt;had a debate&lt;/a&gt; on “Which is a better theory of utilitarianism – Alonzo Fyfe’s desirism or Peter Hurford’s two-level utilitarianism?”.  I wanted to reprint that debate here.  Here’s the first entry (of eight).  This entry was written by Alonzo Fyfe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to defend the claim that desirism (desire utilitarianism) is the best form of utilitarianism - better even than Peter Hurford’s version of RM Hare’s two-level theory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish to start by explaining its differences from other utilitarian theories and suggesting how these make desirism stronger than those other theories.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-utilitarianism&quot;&gt;Types of Utilitarianism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to cut utilitarian theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Utility:&lt;/strong&gt; On this first cut, we distinguish what counts as utility. Candidates include pleasure and freedom from pain (Jeremy Bentham), happiness over unhappiness (John Stuart Mills), preference satisfaction (Peter Singer), and the well-being of conscious creatures (Sam Harris). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objects of Evaluation:&lt;/strong&gt; This second cut looks at primary objects of evaluation. Act utilitarianism makes the evaluation of actions primary - do that act that maximizes utility. Rule utilitarianism makes a rule set primary - do that act that conforms to the best rule set, where the best rule set maximizes utility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two cuts go across each other, allowing for possibilities such as happiness maximizing rule utilitarianism (Mill) or preference satisfaction act utilitarianism (Singer). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;desires-as-the-primary-object-of-evaluation&quot;&gt;Desires as the Primary Object of Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desirism (desire utilitarianism) holds that desires are the primary object of evaluation. On this account, the right act is the act that conforms to the best desire set, and the best desire set is the desire set that maximizes utility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many who heard the term “desire utilitarianism” interpreted it as a candidate for the first cut – the right act is the act that maximizes desire fulfillment. Somebody making this mistake may be tempted to argue: “What about a case where a lot of people desire the torture of a young child? Your theory would say that torturing the child is not only right, but obligatory.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desirism would not make the act obligatory. It would look at the desire to have a young child tortured and see it as a desire that tends to reduce utility. Imagine that the desire did not exist – there will be little to no reason to introduce it and many and strong reasons not to. As a desire that tends to thwart other desires, it is does not have a place in the best desire set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;desirism-as-modified-rule-utilitarianism&quot;&gt;Desirism as Modified Rule Utilitarianism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, desirism takes rule utilitarianism and physically writes the rules into the structures of brains in the form of desires. In doing this, it avoids the most common objection to rule-utilitarianism - that it collapses into act utilitarianism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a situation where an act that follows the rules (saving an innocent person) produces less utility than an act that breaks the rules (killing an innocent person). These are your choices: Perform the act that conforms to the rules, or perform the act that produces the most utility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, a rule utilitarian can avoid this objection by pointing to the efficiency of following a rule of thumb. Yet, that response does not work in cases where we know which act will maximize utility - and yet still hold that the moral requirement is to do something other than maximize utility. When the child is tortured for the satisfaction of 10,000 sadists, we know which option maximizes utility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considerations of utility alone demand performing the act-utilitarian best act. In order to defend obeying the rules in these circumstances we must introduce a principle that says that following the rules has moral value even when it produces less utility. Requiring that rule-following have value independent of utility abandons utilitarianism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, lets write the rules into brains in ways that do not allow this type of choice. A person can forego fulfilling a particular desire, but only if there are more or stronger desires that outweigh it. To perform the act-utilitarian best act, one must have a different desire set - there is no other option. From here, we can ask what is the overall effect of the desire set that would permit the act-utilitarian best act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, desirism takes rule utilitarianism and adds three elements: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The rules are not abstract entities - they refer to the potential structures of physical matter (brains). Physical actions can change these structures, and different structures cause different actions. Our question is: Which structures do we have reason to promote? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The rule sets are inviolable. An individual rule/desire may be broken, but only if outweighed by more or stronger rules/desires stacked against it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The rules/desires are persistent, though changeable. The desires present during any action will motivate an agent’s actions through a wide variety of circumstances. More importantly, the desires we have reason to promote will exist both across agents and across time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ethics-in-likely-versus-exoticimpossible-situations&quot;&gt;Ethics in Likely versus Exotic/Impossible Situations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In evaluating the utility of a rule/desire set, we will need to take into account how likely particular situations are. A desire that produces non-utilitarian outcomes in rare or impossible situations would not count against it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to sidestep many proposed “tests” of utilitarianism. They ask us to imagine an unlikely or impossible situation with an obvious act-utilitarian best act that still seems objectionable. Examples include pushing a fat man onto the path of a runaway trolley thus preventing it from killing five people further down the track, or a doctor killing a healthy patient to harvest five organs to save the lives of five patients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desire utilitarianism says that the utility of desires is to be determined by looking at the situations in which they are likely to play a causal role. Morality concerns refusing to drink and drive, keeping promises, paying debts, leaving the money your co-worker has in her purse, refraining from aggressive violence, abstaining from sex without consent, and not killing or maiming people just because you think that some good might come of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A look at the news tells us that we have a far bigger problem with people killing others when they think some good can come of it than we have with people not being killed - be they political or religious ends or simply punishing somebody the killer thinks deserves to be killed. Weakening the aversion to killing based on fantastic unrealistic scenarios would be foolish. That is exactly the effect of saying that no condemnation is due the person who kills when he thinks good can come of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-utility&quot;&gt;What Is ‘Utility’?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desirism not only makes desires the primary object of moral evaluation, it has something to say about what counts as utility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every desire that P, for some proposition P, provides an agent with a motivating reason to realize states of affairs where P is true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desires for pleasure or happiness provide agents with motivating reasons to realize states where “I am experiencing pleasure” or “I am happy” are true. A desire that one’s children are safe provides a motivating reason to realize states where, “My children are safe” is true. An aversion lying or breaking promises motivates agents to avoid realizing states where, “I am lying” or “I am breaking a promise” are true. An aversion to having any child go hungry provides a motivating reason to realize states where “no child is hungry” is true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of propositions P that define our potential desires is as unbounded as the list of propositions P that define our potential beliefs. This means that the list of things that count as utility is not limited to one or two things. The list may be endless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most utilitarian theories that compete against this model fall into one of three groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;group-1-brain-state-theories&quot;&gt;Group 1: Brain-state theories.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain-state theories identify utility with particular brain states - pleasure, happiness, contentment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain-state theories fail Robert Nozick’s experience machine test. Ask parents whether they would prefer to be put into an experience machine that will feed them sensations that their child is healthy and happy - while the child suffers great agony in fact - and the vast majority would refuse. They are not seeking a brain state, they are seeking a world state where their child is, in fact, healthy and happy. The experience machine does not create a state where P is true, so the experience machine does not hold value for the parent with a desire that their child be healthy and happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;group-2-value-laden-terms&quot;&gt;Group 2: Value-laden terms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another family of utilitarian theories identifies utility with some value-laden concept such as “well-being” or “the good life”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with these theories is that they don’t really answer the question, “What is good?” They simply push the question back to “What is well-being?” or “What is the good life?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desirism can actually answer questions like, “What is well-being?” However, understanding well-being means understanding that it is not the sole content of utility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desirism identifies well-being is a state of being in which an agent’s self-regarding desires are fulfilled. Because such a state realizes some of the things an agent desires, an agent has reason to realize such a state. However, an agent’s self-regarding desires are only a subset of the agent’s desires. Therefore, well-being is only a subset of what counts as utility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many parents would prefer are a greater loss of well-being for themselves to a lesser loss of well-being for their child. This is because their other-regarding concern for their child is something that parents care about in addition to well-being, so that their child’s lesser well-being has more value than their own greater well-being. Such a person would reduce overall well-being, but it does not follow that they are immoral. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;group-3-intrinsic-value-theories&quot;&gt;Group 3: Intrinsic Value Theories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic value theories tell us that some states have intrinsic value, and intrinsic value must be maximized while intrinsic badness minimized. Group 1 and Group 2 are intrinsic value theories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desirism holds that intrinsic value does not exist. A desire that P creates a motivating reason to realize P, not its intrinsic merit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intrinsic value claim may take the form of saying, for example, all preference satisfaction has equal value, so it is wrong to put one person’s preferences above another’s. One must consider one’s child’s preferences as equal to those of another child - as equal to one’s own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desirism can give us reason to deny that a preference for the well-being of one’s family and friends is immoral. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large company seeking only profits will divide its operations into regions, telling each regional director, “You are responsible for this region. In assigning bonuses, for example, do not look at the benefits of giving bonuses to employees in other regions - that is not your job. Look only to your district.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it makes sense to assign each child to an adult and say, “This child is your responsibility. In accepting this responsibility, you are not to treat the interests of each child equally but to concern himself primarily with the interests of this child - leaving others to care for the children assigned to them.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would not be an argument against redistribution. An argument can also be made for taking the surplus resources of some families (regional directors) and investing them in a different region where they can do more good. However, is not inconsistent with the demand that individuals take responsibility for their own children, family, friends, and neighbors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of a desire is not found in its intrinsic merit, but in the reasons that exist for promoting it. In this sense, desires have the same type of value as everything else has - according to its tendency to fulfill or thwart (other) desires. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal here has been to explain the differences between desirism and other forms of utilitarianism in order to highlight its strengths. It is a form of rule utilitarianism that does not collapse into act utilitarianism. As such, it can avoid the objections to act utilitarianism based on exotic cases. Its rules are potential physical entities in the real world. It does not require postulating some type of intrinsic value or any other type of exotic entity. It handles Nozick’s experience machine and provides a real-world answer to the question, “What is value?”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What is it like to be extremely poor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the extremely poor are living on less than what $1.25 a day could buy in the United States.  But this seems implausible.  Wouldn’t someone with that little money just end up dying of starvation very quickly?  Simulations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livebelowtheline.com/&quot;&gt;Living Below the Line&lt;/a&gt; can only go so far.  It’s difficult to understand what it’s like to be that poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s now becoming a bit easier to understand.  Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo, authors of the popular book &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938&quot;&gt;Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and co-founders of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.povertyactionlab.org/&quot;&gt;The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab&lt;/a&gt;, have written a paper called &lt;a href=&quot;http://economics.mit.edu/files/530&quot;&gt;“The Economic Lives of the Poor”&lt;/a&gt;.  Using survey data from thirteen different countries, Banerjee and Duflo are able to tell the tale of life as a poor person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an informative summary of their research.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/how-do-the-extremely-poor-live/village.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;families-compared&quot;&gt;Families Compared&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical extremely poor households tends to be much larger than a US family.  The extremely poor households have a median of 8 people living in them, compared to 2.5 in the US.  However, it’s not typically a couple with many children like one might expect – there actually is a median of 3 adults in a household.  This suggests a family structure where people live with their parents, siblings, uncles, cousins, etc., which makes sense given it is easier to pool resources when you are sharing a space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, poor households do have more children than US households, having about 3 children per woman of child-bearing age, as compared to 1.9 in the US or 1.6 in Europe.  The population of extremely poor areas is also very young in general.  While the US has about one young person (age below 18) for every old person (age above 51), extremely poor areas have a median of six young people for every old person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps to explain why interventions targeted on children, such as school deworming, can have a large impact on the future of these countries - most of the population is young. It also helps to explain higher rates of violence or political instability in poor countries, as violence everywhere is overwhelmingly committed by young men according to Steven Pinker’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Better-Angels-Our-Nature/dp/1455883115&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Angels of Our Nature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-being-extremely-poor-like&quot;&gt;What is Being Extremely Poor Like?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common traits of being extremely poor is weakness and disease.  Because of low food consumption and poor nutrition, 65% of the poor in Udaipur, India (the area with the best data) are underweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;43% of the adults report having difficulty with “activities of daily living”, and this includes 34% of adults under 50.  Furthermore, 55% of the poor have an insufficient red blood cell count (anemia).  In the last month, 72% of the poor in Udaipur report at least one symptom of a disease and 46% of the poor report seeing a doctor because of a disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite constant sickness, self-reported levels of health and happiness are not particularly low, but self-reported levels of stress (both financial and psychological) are very high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, infant mortality is still high.  Surveys have asked women about the outcomes of their pregnancies, including whether the child is still alive.  Infant mortality is the number of children who die before reaching their first birthday, as a percentage of the number of live births.  Among the poor, this number is at a low of 3.4% in Indonesia and a high of 16.7% in Pakistan, compared to 0.5% in Europe.  Notably, these numbers are likely to be underestimates because not all children are remembered, especially if they die very early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/how-do-the-extremely-poor-live/love.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-the-poor-eat&quot;&gt;What Do the Poor Eat?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical poor person could spend about 30% more on food if they wanted to, cutting out all other spending and all savings.  Also, the poor don’t buy food optimally.  In a surveyed region of India, the cheapest way to eat (in terms of calories per dollar) was to buy the grain “millet”.  However, in this region, only about two-thirds of food spending was on millet, with another 20% on rice (which costs about twice as much per calorie), another 10% on wheat (70% more expensive than millets per calorie), and almost 7% on sugar (which is the most expensive per calorie and has no other nutritional value).  I don’t know if this is true of other areas, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite having more ability to buy food, the poor don’t eat much – the households in the bottom 10% of  per capita expenditure consume less than 1400 calories a day on average, which is about half of what is recommended for a man with moderate activity, or a woman with heavy physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, going without food is quite common.  In Udaipur, 45% of poor households reported adults cutting the size of their meal and 12% of households reported children having to cut the size of their meal as well.  In addition, 37% of poor households in Udaipur reported going without a meal for an entire day within the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GiveDirectly, one of GiveWell’s top charities that gives cash transfers to the extremely poor, notes that in their target area of Kenya, “well over half of adults skip meals, less than half of household members eat until they are content, people commonly go to sleep hungry, and a paltry 18% report having enough food for tomorrow”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One type of food that is frequently bought in South India is a dosa, or a rice and beans pancakes that almost everyone eats for breakfast.  This can be bought frequently for a rupee, which is approximately 15 US cents (PPP adjusted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-the-poor-buy&quot;&gt;What Do the Poor Buy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might expect that an extremely poor person is working as hard as they can just to survive, putting every penny earned toward food.  However, this actually isn’t the case – across the thirteen countries studied, food only accounted for 56% to 78% of the budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do the poor spend money on instead?  Surprisingly, spending on education is very low – typically about 2% of budgets.  This is mostly because governments provide free schooling.  In every country sampled except Cote d’Ivoire, at least 50% of boys and girls aged 7 to 12 were in school.  Unfortunately, there’s mounting evidence that the public schools aren’t that good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of spending varies region to region, but a typical extremely poor person spends about 4.1% to 8.1% of their budget on tobacco and alcohol.  Furthermore, in every region except South America, around 10% of the budget was devoted to festivals, like weddings, funerals, or religious celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would the poor spend money on entertainment at the cost of more essential items?  One possibility is that more food wouldn’t help, because they would just end up getting weak from contracting disease later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that entertainment is a strongly felt need that provides an escape from thinking about economic problems. Festivals and similar events also contribute to social bonds that are very important to everyone, but particularly those in poverty who live in riskier environments and more frequently require support from their connections to deal with financial or other difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-a-poor-person-own&quot;&gt;What Does a Poor Person Own?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even among the extremely poor, above 70% of households in South Africa and Peru owned a radio (though only 11% of the poor in Udaipur had a radio).  Furthermore, while no one in Udaipur had a television, in Guatemala, nearly a quarter of households had a television and in Nicaragua almost half of the households did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor generally don’t own many productive assets, but some do have some land.  While only 1.4% of the poor in South Africa and 4% of the poor in Mexico own land, 65% of the poor in Guatemala, 85% of the poor in Panama, and 99% of the poor in Udaipur have land.  Unfortunately, most of this land is dry scrubland that cannot be used for agriculture throughout most of the year.  Furthermore, it’s not much land – a typical household’s plot, if they have land at all, is about one hectare (100m x 100m or 2.4 acres), which is small for a farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other goods that could be used for productivity are in short supply.  In nearly all the areas surveyed, less than 14% of poor households owned a bicycle.  Less than 1% of poor households had sewing machines, bullock cart, motorized cycle, or tractor.  Houses are also pretty sparse.  Banerjee and Duflo’s data showed that while most households had at least one bed or cot, only 10% had a chair or stool and only 5% had a table.  However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.givewell.org/international/site-visits/november-2012#GiveDirectly&quot;&gt;GiveWell’s site visit of Give Directly’s targeted areas&lt;/a&gt; in Kenya showed that living rooms they saw typically had many chairs, tables, and couches and that most homes owned a bicycle, but few houses had radios or television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/how-do-the-extremely-poor-live/bike.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;A bicycle owned by an extremely poor person in Kenya.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor also tend to lack access to basic infrastructure, but it is highly variable.  Access to water varies from a minimum of 0% in Udaipar to 36% in Guatemala.  Electricity varies from 1.3% in Tanzania to 99% in Mexico.  Access to toilets range from 0% in Udaipur to 100% in Nicaragua.  Moreover, infrastructure doesn’t always appear together.  While 97% of poor households in Indonesia have electricity, only 6% have tap water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GiveWell anecdotally noted that of the fifteen households they visited, most homes had three rooms – a sitting room, bedroom, and storage room – varying in size from 10’x12’ to 12’x20’ each.  Generally, the husband and wife would sleep in the bedroom and the children would often sleep in the storage room.  Houses frequently would have a separate kitchen structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GiveWell also observed that people would hang old calendars (like from 2003) for decoration and used kerosene lamps for light because there was no electricity.  They also heard that people walk about 5-20 minutes daily to obtain drinking water.  Furthermore, they observed people owning about 1-2 cows and 4-5 chickens for livestock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-poor-people-get-money&quot;&gt;How Do Poor People Get Money?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 50% of the poor living in Indonesia, 72% in Cote d’Ivoire, 84% in Guatemala, and 94% in Udaipur report working multiple jobs in order to get their income – typically one agricultural and one non-agricultural, though not always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most non-agricultural jobs involve self-employment as a business owner.  Typically, a member of the poor household will migrate (about 60% of families), leaving for a median of one month to find employment in a nearby city.  Others will perform a job earlier in the day, like selling food, and then go out and perform another job, like selling textiles, collect trash, or general labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally these entrepreneurial jobs done by the poor do not require skills.  In Hyderabad, jobs of the poor breakdown to 17% general stores, 11% tailors, 8% fruit and vegetable sellers, 6.6% telephone booth operators, 6.3% milk sellers, and 4.3% auto owners.  Of these, only tailoring requires a specialized skill that takes awhile to acquire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, about 76% of the poor report at least one member of their household working for a public employment program.  Many governments provide safety-net “food for work” programs, which entitle some days of physical labor under government employment at a pre-announced, low wage.  Unfortunately, this kind of work is rare and is often given out in a way that discriminates against the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting question is how the poor would spend additional money, if they got it.  GiveDirectly, by giving cash transfers in $1000 chunks, has been able to find out.  An informal survey conducted by them and shared with GiveWell found that 67% of the money spent went into home improvement (replacing a thatched roof with an iron-sheet roof), 9% went to other (like school uniforms or a motorcycle), 9% went to livestock, and 4% went to food.  However, this survey was only in Kenya, and other areas might spend differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-the-poor-save-and-get-credit&quot;&gt;How Do the Poor Save and Get Credit?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the poor don’t actually have access to a safe place to save money at a reasonable rate of return.  Only 14% of poor households have a savings account (with the exception of Cote d’Ivoire, where the number is 79%).  Even stashing cash in a pillow or a home doesn’t work well because of high inflation and rates of theft.  Additionally, the poor, like everyone else, have problems resisting the temptation to spend money they have at hand, both when family members demand access to it, or when given the option to buy the same indulgences people in developed countries struggle to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also is little access to insurance.  Less than 6% of the poor have access to any kind of health insurance.  Generally, insurance is instead provided through friends and relatives as a type of loan exchange – 75% of poor households report making loans, 65% report borrowing money, and 50% report both.  The most common form of “insurance” to handle economic stress is eating less, taking children out of school, and foregoing medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of insurance or saving leads the poor to under-invest because they cannot accumulate financial assets, or afford to take risks.  Poor families do not specialize in skills and they operate their businesses at a remarkably small scale.  Poor families have access to very limited markets and infrastructure and suffer from a lack of access to credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a life in extreme poverty is one that can be endured and survived, but still not one that is particularly fun.   A life in this kind of poverty is a life without basic utilities, food security, and without many possessions we take for granted.  Instead, it’s a life of malnutrition, disease, and unpredictability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not quite as terrible as it sounds.  The extremely poor people still smile, still laugh, and still play.  They put money into their families and their festivals.  They still appear to be happy, for the most part.   Their lives still contain joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people have told me that it’s pointless to try and cure the extremely poor of malaria, because this means that they’ll just continue their miserable lives and catch a new disease a few months later, and die from that.  However, this is contradicted by the evidence.  Curing people of malaria still allows them to live a better life than they otherwise would and helps contribute to the economic development necessary to make things better.  And people who survive beyond their fifth birthday &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/additional/Standard-of-Living#MortalityandMorbiditywhatarethemajorhealthproblemsinthedevelopingworld&quot;&gt;are more likely than not to live a full life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As GiveWell writes in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.givewell.org/2007/12/04/what-a-life-saved-means/&quot;&gt;“What a ‘Life Saved’ Means”&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Maybe the life you saved is a life without iPhones, but we’re still talking about a person who, at the very least, can be expected to grow up, make friends, fall in love, get in arguments, watch the sunset, have ups and downs, etc.”  I agree.  I’d never say things “aren’t that bad”, because they are.  Things are bad.  But not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can turn things around, and we should.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of effort in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism&quot;&gt;effective altruist movement&lt;/a&gt; right now.  Community building would include anything broadly related to recruitment and retention for the EA movement, aiming to get existing EAs to become more EA (and less likely to quit EA) as well as getting new people to become EA.  This seems &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; to be very high impact for many classical reasons like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration&quot;&gt;haste consideration&lt;/a&gt; that recruiting one person now seems to double your impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not too much EA effort seems channeled into community building at the moment.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.givewell.org&quot;&gt;GiveWell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.80000hours.org/&quot;&gt;80K Hours&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org&quot;&gt;Animal Charity Evaluators&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intelligence.org&quot;&gt;the Machine Intelligence Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; are all primarially research organizations.  Organizations like 80K Hours and ACE once were outreach / community building organizations, but then intentionally rebranded and refocused specifically on research, eschewing community building.  GiveWell has considered many times to improve effort put into marketing, and chosen not to.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as community building goes, we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.givingwhatwecan.org&quot;&gt;Giving What We Can&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/&quot;&gt;The Life You Can Save&lt;/a&gt; doing individual and mass marketing respectively for trying to convince people to help the extremely poor.  We also have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rationality.org&quot;&gt;Centre for Applied Rationality&lt;/a&gt; providing outreach and rationality training.  And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leverageresearch.org/&quot;&gt;Leverage Research&lt;/a&gt; has provided some work, creating &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/&quot;&gt;THINK&lt;/a&gt; for recruitment and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com/&quot;&gt;EA Summit&lt;/a&gt; for retention/unification.  There are also several independently-organized meetup groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just seems like there could be more here.  While there are many EA meetup groups, no one seems to be doing much work to figure out how to scale this approach to create many more groups in many more areas, or spreading best practices between the groups.  The amount of EA outreach that is not focused on global poverty seems really minimal.  The community building that is done seems like it could grow far more in sophistication, especially in terms of measurement, transparency of that measurement, and improving based upon those results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these ideas seem like easy wins that are currently underfunded in both time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure at the moment how far this analysis goes.  I haven’t put much thought into comparing the marginal impact of more research versus more community building.  I also imagine groups have pivoted away from community building for a good reason – I just don’t know what that reason is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Periodically, in times of blog inactivity, I like to come back and report all the things I’ve been doing while not blogging.  Here’s a complete run down of the more recent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I finished up Recruitment for my fraternity.&lt;/strong&gt;  It was basically working a part-time 20hrs/wk job for two weeks doing lots of event planning, but we ended up getting twelve fine men to join our fraternity.  Well worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve been working with Ozzie Gooen on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dotimpact.im&quot;&gt;.impact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a distributed volunteer force working to produce really useful projects.  Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://impact.hackpad.com/Projects-aRiPtncmuKS&quot;&gt;a list of projects our group is working on&lt;/a&gt; and you can check &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotimpact.im/meetings.html&quot;&gt;our meetings log&lt;/a&gt; for their status.  Besides helping coordinate the group as a whole, I’m also working on building a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jobboard.im&quot;&gt;Job Board&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://impact.hackpad.com/Job-Board-G2ZocnkVTsc&quot;&gt;more details here&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/a/peterhurford.com/document/d/1nA3VYi3-UbAOefSWCNcFQQ2fTIceiX1CkyZMIHO-q2Q/edit&quot;&gt;studying vegetarian advocacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve been working on learning more computer programming.&lt;/strong&gt;  In addition to working on the Job Board, I’ve begun to work for a friend’s startup called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jorgestradingpost.com&quot;&gt;Jorge’s Trading Post&lt;/a&gt;, doing some PHP development for them.  I’ve also been learning more Ruby on Rails, Python, and JavaScript.  It helps that I’m now in a Computer Science class and have to program for actual homework.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have been blogging, some.&lt;/strong&gt;  I’ve posted around here, but I’ve also been posting non-utilitarian stuff (gasp!) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://peterhurford.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;my Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still doing Senior Research.&lt;/strong&gt;  I’m researching political optimism and the influence of optimism on political behavior.  We just launched our survey recently on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome&quot;&gt;Amazon’s Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still &lt;a href=&quot;http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=1024&quot;&gt;debating Alonzo Fyfe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;  The topic is whether Alonzo Fyfe’s desirism or my two-level utilitarianism is the better theory of utilitarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still involved in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/service-opportunities/dca&quot;&gt;Denison Community Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the umbrella organization for all volunteer service and service learning on Denison’s campus.  I’m currently working to figure out how to get more people involved in service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still involved in &lt;a href=&quot;https://orgsync.com/custom_pages/10460/show/8585&quot;&gt;Denison Venture Philanthropy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a grant-making organization that gives out $10K and 200 volunteer hours to one non-profit each year.  This year, we’re working with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/southnewark&quot;&gt;South Newark Civic Association&lt;/a&gt; to (1) get them a professional website, (2) do a survey-based needs analysis of the community, and (3) put together a booklet of local businesses.  I’m helping work on the website – not programming, but helping them figure out how to talk to vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still volunteering with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org&quot;&gt;Animal Charity Evaluators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;  Recently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/ace-highlight-organization-evaluation-criteria/&quot;&gt;I helped put together&lt;/a&gt; some detailed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/organization-evaluation-template/&quot;&gt;organization evaluation criteria&lt;/a&gt; that ACE will use to evaluate organizations going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m going to be giving a 12-minute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/tedx&quot;&gt;TEDx talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.givewell.org/giving101&quot;&gt;effective giving&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/whats-happening/tedxdenisonu&quot;&gt;TEDxDenisonU&lt;/a&gt; on the 1st of March.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I haven’t been writing as much as I used to, but one thing I have started getting interested in is writing about “not utilitarianism”.  Thus, I’ve thought it easiest to start a new blog elsewhere: &lt;a href=&quot;http://peterhurford.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;peterhurford.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m on Tumblr as a matter of economy — it seemed like a quick and easy way to make a blog happen without mucking around in Wordpress or Jeckyll or what not.  It will be for all my musings that aren’t philosophical-y or utilitarian-y enough to go on his &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; blog. But I promise this all maximizes utility somehow…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rest assured, I’ll still be keeping this blog going.&lt;/strong&gt;  But sometimes, I’ll have things that are best said elsewhere.  And now I have an elsewhere to say those things.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.montchrishubbard.com/blog/thegift.html&quot;&gt;A profile of Zell Kravinsky&lt;/a&gt;.  Any biography that opens casually with “Last summer, not long after [he] had given almost his entire forty-five-million-dollar real-estate fortune to charity” has to be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking of effective altruism, ever wonder what characteristics effective altruists share?  Joey Savoie and Xio Kikauka &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/07/ea-interview-project.html&quot;&gt;interviewed 42 EAs&lt;/a&gt; and found an average age of 25 (17-46), 75% male, left-wing politics, an average of 20 hours a week on EA volunteering, donating a median of 10% of their income, and generally transitioned from altruism to EA (as opposed to from effectiveness to EA).  Though, admittedly, this survey used a non-random convenience sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://squid314.livejournal.com/260949.html&quot;&gt;we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; put a value on a human life&lt;/a&gt;: “That dollar value is $5.8 million. Denying this leads to terrible consequences. Let me explain.”&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some failures of people doing science:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/02/two-dark-side-statistics-papers/&quot;&gt;How statistics can go wrong&lt;/a&gt; and basically say anything the author wants them to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theamericanconservative.com/jacobs/on-intellectual-triage-and-not-writing-people-off/&quot;&gt;“On Intellectual Triage and Not Writing People Off”&lt;/a&gt;: “Terry Eagleton’s bludgeoning review of Richard Dawkins’s The God Delusion famously begins, ‘Imagine someone holding forth on biology whose only knowledge of the subject is the Book of British Birds, and you have a rough idea of what it feels like to read Richard Dawkins on theology.’ I share Eagleton’s frustration. But what doesn’t bother me — or Eagleton either, I’m pretty sure — is Dawkins’s rejection of religious belief in general or Christianity in particular. Suppose Dawkins were to say something like this: ‘I don’t really know that much about Christianity, but from what I do know I haven’t seen anything that would cause me to take it seriously or to investigate it further.’ I would have absolute respect for that position — because, after all, that’s the position I’m in in relation to all sorts of beliefs: in Zoroastrianism, say, or telekinesis, or alien spacecraft in Roswell, New Mexico.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/j8/the_crackpot_offer/&quot;&gt;“The Crackpot Offer&lt;/a&gt;: “The thought went through my mind:  ‘I’ll get that theorem eventually!  Someday I’ll disprove Cantor’s Diagonal Argument, even though my first try failed!’  I resented the theorem for being obstinately true, for depriving me of my fame and fortune, and I began to look for other disproofs.  And then I realized something.  I realized that I had made a mistake, and that, now that I’d spotted my mistake, there was absolutely no reason to suspect the strength of Cantor’s Diagonal Argument any more than other major theorems of mathematics.  I saw then very clearly that I was being offered the opportunity to become a math crank, and to spend the rest of my life writing angry letters in green ink to math professors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a way to make things a bit better – advance science.  From &lt;a href=&quot;http://80000hours.org/blog/130-three-ways-to-advance-science&quot;&gt;“Three Ways to Advance Science”:&lt;/a&gt; “There are three ways to contribute to scientific progress. The direct way is to conduct a good scientific study and publish the results. The indirect way is to help others make a direct contribution. Journal editors, university administrators and philanthropists who fund research contribute to scientific progress in this second way. A third approach is to marry the first two and make a scientific advance that itself expedites scientific advances. The full significance of this third way is commonly overlooked.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/20/social-justice-for-the-highly-demanding-of-rigor/&quot;&gt;“Social Justice for the Highly Demanding of Rigor”&lt;/a&gt;:  Some people claim “that social justice advocates irresponsibly take some undesirable outcome in minority groups, like poverty, and then assume it is the result of racism or sexism without considering other possible explanations. […] My counterargument is that although the first argument is true a depressingly large amount of the time, some people do more rigorous work and get the same result – that poor outcomes for minority groups are caused in large part by racism and sexism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly as the title says: &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/&quot;&gt;“Anatomy of a Hack: How Crackers Ransack Passwords Like ‘qeadzcwrsfxv1331’”&lt;/a&gt;. Ars Technica gave three experts a 16,000-entry encrypted password file, and asked them to break them. The winner got 90% of them &lt;em&gt;in a few hours&lt;/em&gt;.  And this includes passwords like “momof3gr8kds” and &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/936/&quot;&gt;“correcthorsebatterystaple”&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to make a secure password, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/essay-246.html&quot;&gt;use the Schneier Scheme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html&quot;&gt;“How to Not Die” (as a business)&lt;/a&gt;.  This is why &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dotimpact.im&quot;&gt;.impact&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotimpact.im/meetings.html&quot;&gt;weekly meetings&lt;/a&gt; – weekly meetings encourage a powerful norm of weekly progress, which moves things forward: “You’ve probably noticed that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders causes you to get more done than you would otherwise[. …] Every dinner is […] a deadline. […T]he mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will push you to make things happen, because otherwise you’ll be embarrassed to tell us that you haven’t done anything new since the last time we talked.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/interview-with-jon-behar/&quot;&gt;“Interview with Jon Behar”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon Behar left a lucrative job at the investment management firm to pursue dreams of running philanthropic projects. Behar runs a startup called “A Path That’s Clear” which uses a model called “Giving Games”. These games are run at colleges and other areas around the world and engage people in discussions about effective giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob Wiblin and I sat down to interview Jon Behar and learn more about Giving Games. Here’s what we learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Giving Games” are a way to get people engaged in discussing effective philanthropy by asking them to chose where to give a pot of money from two pre-selected choices&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These games can be used to experimentally test why people don’t give more effectively and find ways to encourage them to give more and give better&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donating to Giving Games could be an option to leverage an existing donation to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.givewell.org/&quot;&gt;GiveWell&lt;/a&gt; top charity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you describe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apaththatsclear.com/&quot;&gt;“A Path That’s Clear”&lt;/a&gt;? What does it do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission is simple and consistent with the mission of “Giving What We Can” - encouraging people to both give more generously and more effectively than they otherwise would. I aim to accomplish this by running “Giving Games”, which is just a very simple way to engage people in conversations about effective giving. We gather people together and have a conversation about which charity they would like to give to from a few pre-selected options. The group is also given real funds to make a real donation, which gives participants a sense of ownership over the decision and also engages them in a conversation that encourages them to take a strategic approach to giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve run about 25 Giving Games, most of which have taken place at colleges, though several were online and in other settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes this model appealing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see the model as a way to experimentally test why people fail to give effectively and see if we can find any methods to get them onto giving effectively. A Path That’s Clear can test these things as hypotheses. Maybe people are afraid of putting up their own money? Well A Path That’s Clear provides the money needed to make the decision. Maybe people don’t have easy access to high-quality information on effective charities? A Path That’s Clear can provide that information. Maybe people just think that “charity begins at home”? We can test that by running a Giving Game with a local non-profit and a non-profit working in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the results of the Giving Games?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, we’re looking at the decisions players make to see if they actually give to more effective charities and see if they are thinking more about strategic giving. We do this through post-game surveys that ask players about their experiences and then also by getting feedback from the moderator of the Game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual results of the Games are encouraging - in nearly all the games, the players have selected the more effective charity. But more importantly, players are indicating that their experience in the Game has changed how they think about philanthropy; they resolve to do more research and think about impact the next time they personally give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also taken audio recordings of the Giving Games so I can listen in and the conversation flows freely. One of the driving factors for this is that we’re not just getting a random group together, but rather a group with lots of existing social ties (club, sports team, dorm room floor, class) that are already comfortable with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the model changed, if at all, in response to these trials?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started out pitting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.againstmalaria.com/&quot;&gt;Against Malaria Foundation&lt;/a&gt; against, not another charity, but rather the option of letting players keep the money themselves. In this game, people chose AMF, but this decision was probably too obvious and the discussion was not as deep as we would have hoped. Once we decided to make the conversation about two different effective charities or about testing critical notions like “giving begins at home”, we found the conversations started really going somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your plan for scaling this up? Who are you going to target? And what is your plan for making this sustainable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long-term, I’d like to institutionalize this process at as many schools, universities, and workplaces as I can, though our main focus is on colleges and universities. I want to embed this conversation about how one can do the most good and make this part of the college experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran a Giving Game at Brandeis University with 25 students as part of their orientation process. That could serve as a pilot to hopefully making the Giving Game or this type of discussion part of the welcoming process of all students. I have started to very recently partner with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/&quot;&gt;The Life You Can Save&lt;/a&gt; to run Giving Games under their brand. I also have a few other leads and I’m optimistic we’d be able to get other donors out there. Lastly, I also intend to run an experiment soon with some economists at George Mason University who study giving behaviour. We’ll do a Giving Game in a laboratory setting without a social component, because the social component makes it very difficult to control for variables. We’re going to try and test some of the really basic assumptions of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s nice about the model is that anyone can run a Giving Game. Any donor who wants to leverage their giving by running a Giving Game can do so. I want to encourage as many people as possible to take the idea and run with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you intend to pay this? Including costs of running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I’d been funding this out of pocket, but I’m excited about this partnership with The Life You Can Save which opens up a lot more resources. I think that the bulk of the cost will be covered by donations, especially once we get up to scale. Luckily, I think there are a lot of people who would potentially donate to Giving Games. Anyone who is already thinking of donating to a GiveWell top charity can accomplish the exact same donation while also funding us, basically for free, leveraging their impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the amount of money on the table affect things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much. It does need to meet some sort of threshold to get people interested, usually in the $50 to $250 range. However, in an activities fair, for example, even asking people to decide about a dollar was enough to get them to engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would cause you to give up with Giving Games? Do you have an exit strategy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the hope is that we’ll get people to give more and give better. I need to trust the data to see if we actually do that. If we do five experiments and they all indicate that Giving Games turn people into, say, selfish misanthropic people, I need to respect that. I want to be very conscious as we’re setting up the impact measuring systems to measure both the potential positive impacts and the potential negative impacts as well. Therefore, I think we need to get better at systematically measuring our actual impact. The surveys we have in place are nice, but then you have to trust self-reports, and our surveys aren’t long-term enough. The logistics here are difficult because we’re talking about people in their teens and twenties and we care about how people will give over the next 60+ years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I’d like to do is to get some actual donation tracking set-up, but this introduces privacy concerns. The bottom line is that we’re going to have to come up with clever ways to get real-time windows into those long-term dynamics. I think this will be a continual process of ramping up and it will really be ongoing, basically have already been started in the past. The experiment at George Mason that I mentioned earlier will be a big step in the right direction and hopefully even this coming academic year we’ll have significantly more ability to measure what we’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think is the greatest weakness of the approach?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there’s a potential for crowding out. There is the problem of people giving better but giving less, which is a consistent finding in the existing literature. My gut feeling is that it is not going to be an issue and crowding out will be quite minimal because you’re concerned about crowding out not in the immediate aftermath, but rather over the participants’ lifetimes. Given that most participants have a positive reaction to the game, I don’t expect it to be a big issue, but it merits closer investigation and hopefully the George Mason experiment will shed light on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you had any success getting people to become Giving What We Can members or &lt;a href=&quot;http://80000hours.org/&quot;&gt;80,000 Hours&lt;/a&gt; members through the games?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-06-02/how-giving-games-can-spread-the-word-about-smarter-charity-choices-0&quot;&gt;run Giving Games through Giving What We Can chapters&lt;/a&gt; where the chapter reaches out to random groups of students and asks them to participate. Generally, we’ve found that this does get those random people interested in participating in their local GWWC Chapter. But we don’t have any evidence further than that and we don’t know anyone who’s taken the Pledge as a result of a Giving Game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can other people get involved in “A Path That’s Clear”? If so, how?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can email info@apaththatsclear.com or get in touch through the contact us form. We love to get inquiries and we’re eager to talk to folks and get people as involved as we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in May 2013, I realized I would be graduating in a year and wondered a lot about what I should pick for my first career. The questions I had at the time were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should I aim to work in an Effective Altruist organization, go to graduate school, or should I earn to give?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where should I look for employment if I want to earn to give - law, market research, or programming?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spent a little time considering other options (finance and consulting careers), but the bulk of my time was spent comparing EA org employment, grad school, and the three earning to give careers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Direct work in EA is promising, but there are limited employment opportunities and a generally strong base of talent to draw from that makes replaceability an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Graduate school also seems promising, but programs with high direct impact seem limited in employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s important to consider factors about the career other than salary when doing earning to give. Law was my best earning to give opportunity at first glance, given that it had the highest salary of the options I was willing to consider. But when I looked more deeply at non-salary factors, it became my worst option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Market research and computer programming are my most promising paths and I should consider both further. They allow good salary potential while offering many other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publishing my ongoing thought process was valuable in ways I couldn’t even imagine at the time, creating the opportunity to meet people I couldn’t have met otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spending time directly in Oxford was also incredibly valuable in meeting with people that could help me think through my decision process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An analytically-minded person can train in programming quickly enough to seriously consider programming as a career path. While I started with intermediate computer programming knowledge in irrelevant computer languages, it took me about 150 hours of training over 20 weeks to know enough to interview competently. I don’t know if this is a unique case, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-methodology&quot;&gt;My methodology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I compiled a list of every high impact career I could conceive of. I then narrowed the list down to the careers I thought were worth pursuing further, based on personal factors, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-plan/&quot;&gt;published that information online&lt;/a&gt; for comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of time following up on the comments I received from publishing, I then deliberately set out, crafted a set of questions I wanted to know about various opportunities, and interviewed people about them. I ended up having informational interviews with 31 different people, including five people from 80,000 Hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I did an internship at Giving What We Can in Oxford, England. This taught me a lot about the opportunities for direct work and put me in a position to meet with 80,000 Hours and a lot of other effective altruists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the information I gathered from my interviews, I compared my five options on the basis of 11 different criteria, as suggested by 80,000 Hours. I also pursued all five options to the best of my ability until I had the confidence to eliminate options. Eventually, I came to a final decision I could be confident in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-these-five-categories-and-not-others&quot;&gt;Why these five categories, and not others?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many careers I didn’t consider much – such as finance, consulting, and medicine - which seem to be popular careers of those who use 80,000 Hours’s research. I didn’t choose any of these three careers mainly because I felt underqualified and felt that they would be enough of a poor fit for me enjoyment-wise that I wouldn’t do well enough in the career. I’m currently open to changing my mind on finance due to the extremely high earning potential, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some opportunities for direct work, like fundraising (along the lines of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.effectivefundraising.net/&quot;&gt;Effective Fundraising’s&lt;/a&gt; model), I didn’t investigate further because the options were too limited. Other opportunities, like working in non-profit organizations doing work on the ground, like Innovations for Poverty Action, didn’t seem to match my skills or interests very well and didn’t seem enjoyable to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also didn’t feel comfortable and confident enough to be an entrepreneur. While I’m open to potentially creating a start-up someday, I wanted a lot more knowledge of how organizations work and what the market is like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-was-my-first-guess&quot;&gt;What was my first guess?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first guess, made on May 2013, was that the best thing for me to do would be to do direct work (seek employment in the Centre for Effective Altruism) and enter law school and do earning to give if the first plan didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-factors-did-i-use-to-compare-my-careers&quot;&gt;What factors did I use to compare my careers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After talking with Jess Whittlestone and Nick Beckstead from 80,000 Hours, I adopted the following 9 criteria for evaluating my career:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; The actions of the career itself directly improve the world. (Technically, all these other measures are supposed to be measures of indirect impact.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earnings:&lt;/strong&gt; The career has a large compensation package.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; The career will develop me in valuable, personal, transferable skills that are useful for furthering my career or otherwise being better at effective altruism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connections:&lt;/strong&gt; The career will connect me with people that can help me a lot down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credentials:&lt;/strong&gt; The career will look good on my resume, improve my impressiveness for employers, and qualify me for better jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information Value:&lt;/strong&gt; The career teaches me more about what career opportunities there are and improves the quality of my future career choices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; The career keeps my options open in terms of allowing me to switch to another career easily.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoyment:&lt;/strong&gt; I would enjoy the career.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replaceability:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not doing something that someone else easily would do just as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;should-i-do-direct-work&quot;&gt;Should I do direct work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct work seemed good on direct impact, skills, connections, flexibility, and enjoyment, but weak on earnings, credentials, information value, and replaceability. I spent a lot of time trying to assess my own replaceability in direct work before a conversation with Satvik Beri outlined an incredibly simple procedure - just ask EA organizations whether they’d rather have you or money. I was in a good position to do this, having just interned for an EA organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I interned, I felt like I produced above average work, but I didn’t think my work was significantly better and I hadn’t adjusted for the fact that people tend to think more highly of themselves than is justified. When I take these two aspects into account, replaceability becomes a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a larger concern for me that emerged after talking to people was that employment in an EA organization is actually rather difficult to come by, given a limited number of positions and for the time-being has high standards in recruiting due to being a start-up and needing lots of particular skills. This was especially a concern for me given that I am an American citizen but most desire employment in the UK-based Centre for Effective Altruism, as CEA faces some difficulty in hiring Americans full-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final concern of mine was the possibility of coming to a major disagreement with CEA about what the best approach is for making the world a better place. While this was not a dominant consideration, the flexibility and independence provided by an earning to give career seems like a benefit to me. This seemed especially true if I picked a career that still affords me training in skills relevant to EA direct work and/or gives me a significant amount of time to volunteer for EA causes, as I could transition to direct work if I felt like my skills were better served there than earning. Generally, I felt like it is easier to transition from earning-to-give to direct work than it is to transition from direct work to earning-to-give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I decided to no longer seek full-time direct work for the time-being. However, I still believe that some kinds of direct work (personal EA side-projects) are higher value to me than spending the time earning a high salary, so I want to choose a career that allows me the flexibility to also have a significant side-project / volunteering component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;should-i-go-to-graduate-school&quot;&gt;Should I go to graduate school?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I chose this option, I would pursue a Ph.D. in either political science or psychology. I had considered a Ph.D. in economics, but felt underqualified and felt like I wouldn’t enjoy it enough to make it worthwhile. I was searching for programs that would allow me to study the psychology of civic engagement, volunteerism, and/or donating. For example, I became very attracted to the work of Elizabeth Dunn at the University of British Columbia and considered trying to apply there (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog/tabid/107/ID/45/Flipping-the-Philanthropy-Switch.aspx&quot;&gt;“Flipping the Philanthropy Switch”&lt;/a&gt; over at The Life You Can Save for more on this kind of work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option seemed to be strong on connections, credentials, enjoyment, replaceability, and skills (though skills is debated as the skills learned may only be useful for academic work). However, it seemed weak on flexibility/risk and earnings. It also would be weak on direct impact depending on what program I chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I decided against graduate school and while I did take the GRE (the US admissions test for grad schools), I chose not to move forward on any applications. While I found research to be high-value, my intuition was that I would have more influence in making key research happen by funding research rather than carrying it out. Also, I felt like I could do a large majority of the research I want to do (currently, mostly stuff related to studying vegetarianism) without taking on the costs of graduate school. Lastly, I felt like there were enough people already working in the graduate programs I had considered that I wouldn’t add much (one could think of this as having no “room for more people”, as an analogy to “room for more funding” in GiveWell top charities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think it’s unlikely, I wouldn’t rule out trying to apply to graduate schools in late 2014 or late 2015, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-good-is-law-for-earning-to-give&quot;&gt;How good is law for earning to give?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With graduate school and direct work out of the way, I focused up more on earning to give. The first I focused on was law as I saw that it had the highest salary potential of the options I was considering. If I pursued law, I would aim to enter corporate law, which pays at $160K per year and then rises by ~$10K/year for ten years before you have an opportunity to make partner and earn $500K/year to millions a year depending on the firm. Law seemed strong on salary, connections, replaceability, and credentials, but had drawbacks in skills, direct impact, information value, and enjoyment. It is also utterly terrible in flexibility, considering I would have to pay money into three years of law school before I would earn anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty keen on law for several months as a top choice, but I ultimately stopped valuing it as much as I started to place more emphasis on personal enjoyment, skills development, and flexibility. Eventually, having to commit three years and $50-$150K to law school with no promise that I would end up in a situation that worked well for me was a pretty clear deal-breaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of law that I came to really not like was the expected long hours of the job, which would prevent me from being able to spend significant amounts of time on EA side projects. Since I expect that I will be able to do side projects that produce more EA value than earning to give, this also made me not like law as much relative to the more 40-60 hour a week careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still took the LSAT (the US entrance exam for law schools) anyway, because I had prepared for it a lot, and thought it would be nice to have the score. I ended up doing well on it, but not well enough that my admittance to the top 10 law schools would be likely. (Common wisdom suggests that one needs to be in a top 10 law school in order to have a good shot at a corporate law job.) So, unless I retake the LSAT, this option was pretty much over whether I wanted it to be or not. Given that I had already decided before seeing my LSAT score that I didn’t want to do law, I wasn’t that upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-good-is-market-research-for-earning-to-give&quot;&gt;How good is market research for earning to give?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general idea is that I’d seek employment doing statistics for a market research firm. This seemed strong on skills, flexibility, enjoyment, replaceability, and information value and not particularly weak on much, though salary, credentials, and connections seem weaker than other options, relatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salaries are lower in market research, with starting salaries in the $40K-$60K range and less indication of upward movement in salaries with promotion. But one potential advantage I hadn’t considered much is that few EAs, if any, had gone into market research, so it could be a ripe new field to explore for EA potential, especially if marketing principles could then be applied directly to the EA movement. Therefore, I’m still seeking employment in market research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-good-is-programming-for-earning-to-give&quot;&gt;How good is programming for earning to give?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also considered computer programming as an earning to give career, which is quite popular in the effective altruism movement. Like market research, this also seemed strong on skills, flexibility, enjoyment, replaceability, and information value and not particularly weak on much. Salaries are good, starting in the $50-$80K range and rising upward to $120-$200K, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about computer programming for me is that, while I was a long-time hobbyist programmer, I had never really pursued programming seriously, I didn’t have a tremendous amount of experience, and I lacked a computer science degree. So I needed to spend a significant amount of time learning programming. Luckily, the market for programming jobs is good and a lot of companies are willing to focus on “on-the-job learning” if you can demonstrate your general aptitude and your ability to learn quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds good to me, so I’m still seeking employment in programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-was-my-final-decision&quot;&gt;What was my “final” decision?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I decided to go with a model where I would mix both direct work and earning to give by seeking full-time employment for 40-60 hours a week, but then spending significant portion of my “free time” volunteering and doing EA side projects. I liked this model the most because I expect the side projects to be worth more than additional salary and it should teach me more about the comparison between earning to give and direct work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months after starting my plan to learn about jobs (and one month after sending applications), I received an offer of an 8-week “trial hire” internship from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avantcredit.com&quot;&gt;AvantCredit&lt;/a&gt;, a web development start-up that offers online loans to people with near-prime credit ratings. I got this offer on the basis of experience in both web development and statistics. I accepted the offer and I’m excited to be employed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AvantCredit offers a mixture of interesting challenges in both programming and statistics, which are two skill-bases of mine I want to improve. The office culture sounds pretty awesome. Additionally, I’ll gain experience about what it’s like to be in a start-up and learn more about finance and financial risk, in case I want to look more in finance. I also think there’s a strong chance I might end up staying with AvantCredit long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer-term, I’m still looking at careers in market research and computer programming. I’m also looking into jobs that offer &lt;a href=&quot;http://doublethedonation.com/matching-grant-resources/list-matching-gifts-companies/&quot;&gt;particularly high donation matching&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically &lt;a href=&quot;http://80000hours.org/blog/168-how-to-double-your-donations-with-no-extra-effort&quot;&gt;like a raise for effective altruists&lt;/a&gt;, though I haven’t explored this much in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-i-learn&quot;&gt;What did I learn?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked the methodology I ended up using. Initially, I was worried that writing up information about my career choice publicly could lead to employers viewing my application more negatively and hurting my chances at receiving offers. I still can’t rule this out, but I do think the benefits of publicly publishing have more than made up for it. Publishing the work lead to people commenting on it who became great contacts that I would not have made any other way. One of these contacts ended up telling me about AvantCredit and giving me an internal referral. I don’t think I would have received the offer without his help, let alone known to apply in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think it was a really good idea to take an internship at Giving What We Can, which I actually considered not doing at one point (because I was worried about not seeing my family for most of the summer). There really is no substitute for joining an EA hub directly and meeting tons of EAs in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I learned that you apparently can train yourself to learn enough programming to get a job offer at a moderately quick pace, though I may have got lucky with a variety of things. I spent 10 hours a week on programming over a period of about 10 weeks, and about 5 hours a week on programming for the 10 weeks before that, prior to receiving the AvantCredit offer. In doing so, I was able to significantly increase my knowledge of jQuery, Ruby on Rails, and R. I hope to up this commitment to make sure I’m even more ready when I get there and when looking at other companies. Notably, I received an offer from AvantCredit also based on knowledge of statistics and from having an internal referral, so I don’t know if I will end up having enough experience to interview well at other companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-would-i-have-done-differently-if-i-could-start-over&quot;&gt;What would I have done differently, if I could start over?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I was able to more quickly identify that grad school and law school wouldn’t pan out and therefore not “waste” the time studying for and doing the GRE and LSAT. There definitely were warning signs I could have seen respectively if I had spent more time comparing the careers to my other options. Also, I could have seen the lack of good graduate school programs and the problem with having unrealistic expectations about the kind of LSAT scores I could achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I’d be worried that heuristics that would have saved me time via the GRE and the LSAT would also have cut out computer programming, however, as I was also concerned that training in programming quickly was too much of a dream and I wouldn’t know enough fast enough, which turned out to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much less significant of an issue, I also wish I had refined my decision criteria a bit more. The nine factor model I used in this essay actually was an 11-factor model that included “risk” and “cost”, but both of these considerations ended up being unnecessary. Additionally, my thinking in some of the other categories could be refined. I like the five-factor model offered in &lt;a href=&quot;http://80000hours.org/blog/280-a-comparison-of-medical-research-and-earning-to-give&quot;&gt;“A Comparison of Medical Research and Earning to Give”&lt;/a&gt; and probably would adopt that if making broad comparisons again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-impact-did-80000-hours-have-in-this-decision-process&quot;&gt;What impact did 80,000 Hours have in this decision process?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the existence of 80,000 Hours completely changed my career, but the choice to pursue additional coaching did not further assist in making my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I looked into 80,000 Hours, I was pretty intent on pursuing a Ph.D. in political science for a long time, and thought that would be a great career path for me. (I still do think it would be very enjoyable; I just think it’s less impactful than my other options.) Despite engagement with effective altruism, I hadn’t considered that maybe this career path was wasn’t the best route until I had a conversation with William MacAskill. I think 80,000 Hours has done a lot to put the idea of career choice into the general EA zeitgeist. I am nearly certain I would not have spent any time considering the ethics of career choice if 80,000 Hours did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual career advice session was not useful to me, but I suspect this is because I was an unusual case - (a) I had already come in to the advice session having done a significant amount of research on my own that I would have done otherwise; (b) I was already very familiar with 80,000 Hours’s content having read all of their research material, completed a workshop with them, and worked in their office; and (c) my particular decision most hinged on very particular details about salaries and career capital that no one had done comprehensive research on yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the workshop I had completed for 80,000 Hours was impactful because it moved me away from thinking solely about the impact of my career and more about thinking about the skills and career capital I would develop in my career, which I agree &lt;a href=&quot;http://80000hours.org/blog/237-your-career-is-like-a-startup&quot;&gt;is a better model for thinking about careers&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the conversations I had with people working for 80,000 Hours – Jess Whittlestone, Roman Duda, William Macaskill, Benjamin Todd, Nick Beckstead, and Pablo Stafforini – as a part of my personal research were all helpful in thinking more about my career choice. Therefore, I strongly suspect that a careers advising session with 80,000 Hours would be beneficial to many people thinking about their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I did heavily rely on research done by 80,000 Hours to inform my decision - both in assisting my initial selection of high-impact options and in comparing them. The existence of 80,000 Hours moved me away from pursuing a Ph.D. program in political science toward earning to give in web development. 80,000 Hours very much impacted my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Someone asked me what the top ten posts are on Everyday Utilitarian.  I use Google Analytics, so this was a pretty easy thing to find out.  I looked at page visits for each essay over all of 2013.  Of course, this isn’t a perfect metric, as essays written later in the year have less of a chance of getting viewed, and the “hits” metric is skewed a lot toward what I choose to publicize via Facebook and LessWrong and what I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this isn’t much of a “top ten” by quality, I suppose.  But here it goes, anyway:&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/sunday-links-20/#comment-1284119265&quot;&gt;promised to make the link roundups relate a little better&lt;/a&gt;, so here you go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals&quot;&gt;The Millenium Development Goals&lt;/a&gt; set priorities for governments and NGOs working to help the developing world.  However, the current set only covers 2000-2015, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.post2015hlp.org/the-report/&quot;&gt;a new set&lt;/a&gt; is being developed for 2015-2030.  What should be included?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-07-30/measuring-what-matters-two-key-indicators-for-the-successor-development-goals&quot;&gt;Toby Ord suggests&lt;/a&gt; including a metric of “healthy life expectancy”, or life expectancy weighted by quality of life, and “log income”, which correlates pretty highly with life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of “log income” is that giving money to the poorest should more easily boost total world satisfaction than giving the money most other places.  Luckily, there’s an organization, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.givedirectly.org&quot;&gt;Give Directly&lt;/a&gt;, that does just that, who I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/givedirectly-the-best-gift-you-can-make-this-christmas/&quot;&gt;profiled earlier&lt;/a&gt;.  They’re also profiled in Tina Rosenberg’s Fixes Column entry &lt;a href=&quot;http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/the-benefits-of-cash-without-conditions&quot;&gt;“The Benefits of Cash Without Conditions”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Singer argues that if you’d save the life of a small child near you, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alternet.org/story/146958/peter_singer%3A_would_you_save_the_life_of_a_child&quot;&gt;you should also be willing to donate to one of these charities&lt;/a&gt;.  After all, the idea of distance mattering in ethics &lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/17/newtonian-ethics/&quot;&gt;is quite weird indeed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in a related note, Carl Shulman works &lt;a href=&quot;http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/01/turning-log-consumption-into-measure-of.html&quot;&gt;to try and turn log-income and log-consumption into better metrics of human welfare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.govexec.com/excellence/promising-practices/2013/01/googles-8-simple-rules-being-better-manager/60882/&quot;&gt;Google has eight simple rules for being a better manager:&lt;/a&gt; (1) be a good coach, (2) empower your team and don’t micromanage, (3) express interest in team members’ success and personal well-being, (4) be productive and results-oriented, (5) be a good communicator, (6) help employees with career development, (7) have a clear vision and strategy, and (8) have key technical skills so you can be an advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a related note, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spring.org.uk/2013/09/6-psych-tips-for-creating-the-ideal-workspace.php&quot;&gt;“Six Psych Tips for Creating the Ideal Workspace”&lt;/a&gt;: (1) avoid open-plan; (2) both messy and untidy desks have their place, depending on the type of outcome you are looking for; (3) prefer curvy environments over straight edges, (4) have a room with a view or a picture of a view, (5) include lots of plants, and (6) decorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.philosophyetc.net/2012/11/ethics-as-whats-worth-caring-about.html&quot;&gt;“Ethics as What’s Worth Caring About”:&lt;/a&gt; “The utilitarian can simply say, ‘I care about people!  I want everyone to be as well-off as possible.’  And that seems a pretty attractive goal!  There seems no doubt that people’s welfare (and, more broadly, the welfare of sentient beings) is worth caring about.  Is anything else comparably important, or worth caring about?  Take promises.  People sometimes criticize utilitarianism on the grounds that it affords no intrinsic significance to promise-keeping, so utilitarians may be expected to break promises (at least when it’s sufficiently clear that it really would be for the best).  But does it really make sense to care about promises more than people?  That sounds terribly perverse!  Promises can be a useful tool for coordination, and hence serving our collective interests.  But when promise-keeping and human welfare diverge, surely it’s the latter that really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A somewhat related triumph for utilitarianism comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/bk/the_trouble_with_good/&quot;&gt;The Trouble With “Good”&lt;/a&gt;: “One person can go on and on for months about all the reasons the Israelis are totally right and the Palestinians are completely in the wrong, and another person can go on just as long about how the Israelis are evil oppressors and the Palestinians just want freedom. And then if you ask them about an action, or a decision, or a state - they’ve never thought about it. They’ll both answer something like ‘I dunno, the two-state solution or something?’. And if they still disagree at this level, you can suddenly apply the full power of utilitarianism to the problem in a way that tugs sideways to all of their personal prejudices.  In general, any debate about whether something is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ is sketchy, and can be changed to a more useful form by converting the thing to an action and applying utilitarianism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathy-freston/religion-vegetarianism-_b_3874652.html?utm_hp_ref=tw&quot;&gt;“God, Christianity, and Meat”&lt;/a&gt; – an interesting religious perspective on vegetarianism: “I was delighted to learn about this rich tradition of incorporating vegetarian diets into spiritual practice, but I admit that it first surprised me. It certainly is not something most Christians in America know about. If you do some searching like I did, though – even simply by searching “Christianity and vegetarianism” on the Internet – it’s easy to see just how important the idea of peace between all creatures has been in the Christian moral imagination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/04/25/were-all-bad-at-math-1-i-feel-stupid-too/&quot;&gt;“What it Feels Like to Be Bad at Math”&lt;/a&gt; (also applicable to all other hard subjects and things): “As I procrastinated, spending more time at dinner complaining about topology than in the library doing topology, I realized that procrastination isn’t just about laziness. It’s about anxiety. To work on something you don’t understand means facing your doubts and confusions head-on. Procrastination pushes back that painful confrontation.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked about .impact in a few other places, but now we’ve finally written a summary of it and have launched a new website. Look here to see what we’re up to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dotimpact.im/2014/01/05/introducing-dotimpact/&quot;&gt;“Introducing .impact”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are many project ideas that could be really useful for the effective altruist community. There are people with the skills and free time to make things happen but who lack guidance or support. .impact aims to provide infrastructure to get people and useful projects together. We hope to help volunteers learn useful skills, meet great people, and create something substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re soon launching &lt;a href=&quot;http://skillshare.im/&quot;&gt;Skillshare.im&lt;/a&gt;, a place to share skills and services for free. We collaborated on several Trello boards to &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/npVl3e9d/effective-altruist-project-board&quot;&gt;organize projects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/shY5TwCm/effective-altruist-research-topics&quot;&gt;research topics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/F3O577AH/ea-productivity-resources&quot;&gt;useful resources&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve brainstormed and started outlining projects like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://impact.hackpad.com/Studying-Vegetarian-Advocacy-m11aW51ENVW&quot;&gt;vegetarian advocacy study&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://impact.hackpad.com/EA-Wiki-y8z6wp5yCxD&quot;&gt;EA wiki&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://impact.hackpad.com/Argument-Mapper-hNKt3IU7gAv&quot;&gt;argument mapping software&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve had &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotimpact.im/meetings.html&quot;&gt;several weekly group hangouts and discussions&lt;/a&gt; with a variety of individuals. Most of our general discussion holds place in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/dotimpact/&quot;&gt;our Facebook group&lt;/a&gt;, which now has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/dotimpact/members/&quot;&gt;114 members&lt;/a&gt; and seems to be growing organically at a rate of 5 per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
