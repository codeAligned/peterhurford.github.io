  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Welcome to the third edition of Sunday Links!  This time, I want to explore links on one particular concept: <em>effective altruism</em>, a concept near and dear to both my heart and utilitarianism.</p>

<p>Peter Singer summarizes effective altruism <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Diuv3XZQXyc">in his recent TED Talk</a>.</p>

<p>What’s the key idea?  Will Crouch <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/node/4">defines effective altruism</a> as starting with a “how” (a desire to do as much good as possible) and moving to a “what” (whatever does the most good), instead of the typical model of altruism, which starts with a “what” (ending cancer) and moving to a “how” (whatever campaigns end cancer).  It’s very closely related to the idea of <a href="http://www.tacticalphilanthropy.com/2010/10/the-rise-of-issue-agnostic-philanthropy/">issue-agnostic philanthropy</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest take away is that philanthropy involves trade-offs, because donating in one place means we’re not donating in another place.  However, because our money could have gone further elsewhere, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">we end up hurting people unintentionally</a>.  My favorite case for understanding the need for effective altruism involves Scott Siskind’s <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/">summary of efficient charity</a>, which I referenced before.  To make the idea of opportunity costs in spending apparent, Scott Siskind also jokingly suggests <a href="http://www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html">we adopt dead child currency</a>.</p>

<p>One example of effective altruism is to <a href="http://www.givewell.org/want-to-change-peoples-lives-give-internationally">focus more on the developing world than on the developed world</a>.  This might seem unintuitive at first, but when I think about it <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/49-on-triage">in terms of triage</a> or Julia Wise’s <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2012/02/our-worst-subjects.html">notion of worst subjects</a>, it makes sense to me.  Jeff Kaufman’s <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2011-10-15">debate with a pro-local friend of his</a> also helps.</p>

<p>But wouldn’t this be really hard?  Well, the secret is that <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/why-give/how-rich-am-i">we’re rich</a>, compared to the developing world.  But even so, <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/03/it-doesnt-have-to-be-hard.html">it doesn’t have to be hard</a>.  You could just start <em>somewhere</em>, for some amount.</p>

<p>Where should you start?  I recommend a few places, like <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com">The Life You Can Save</a>, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>. <a href="http://80000hours.org">80000 Hours</a>, and <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/">Effective Animal Activism</a>.</p>

<p>There’s much more that needs to be said, but this should be enough to get you going.  A whole world of helping more by “working smarter, not harder” awaits.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>For-profit organizations (better known as <em>businesses</em>) are in many ways much more simple than non-profit organizations.  When it comes to a pizza place, their goal is to sell me a delicious cheese pizza for $12.95 and my goal is to find the most delicious cheese pizza I can with my $12.95.  When our goals overlap, I give them my money and they give me their pizza.</p>

<p><strong>For businesses, knowing you are successful is also easy</strong> – the critical metric of profit is hitting the business in the face every time the cash register opens, and it’s easy to document whether it’s going up or down.  We can tell if a business is successful just by looking at these numbers, and we have no need for randomized controlled trials to see if making pizza is <em>really</em> the cause of profit, or if a pizza place could remain profitable without selling anything.</p>

<p><strong>Also for businesses, you are automatically accountable for failure.</strong>  In bigger companies, you get fired by your shareholders.  Or, you simply stop finding yourself having enough money to pay salaries and keep the place open.  If your product isn’t serving it’s customers, you quickly go out of business.  You don’t have to notice if you’re doing bad, because doing badly will just catch up with you.

    <p>I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">previously mentioned</a> that individuals can make a large difference in the lives of others through donations, as long as they choose very cost-effective charities.  However, while our donation does make a difference to a few people, there are much more massive institutions working to make much bigger differences in the well-being of those in other countries – <em>foreign aid</em>.</p>

<p>Foreign aid aims to eliminate extreme hunger, extreme poverty, and disease from the world altogether and usher everyone into lives in which they can be happy and live to their potential.  Because foreign aid is perhaps the biggest attempt to make the world a better place, it is important to me that we get this right.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we haven’t gotten it right quite yet.  Fifty years of foreign aid efforts later, and extreme poverty, extreme hunger, and disease still exist.  While it may seem wildly idealistic to believe that extreme poverty, extreme hunger, and disease can be eliminated soon, Peter Singer in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-You-Can-Save/dp/1400067103"><strong>The Life You Can Save</strong></a> argues that the elimination of all three plights is within our reach if only we studied foreign aid, looked at its failures, and made some modifications.  In this essay, I explore his chapter on foreign aid.

    <p>Imagine you came across a store offering the following options:</p>

<p><strong>Blue Coffee Mug:</strong> $1</p>

<p><strong>Red Coffee Mug:</strong> $1050</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>After thorough inspection, you discover that both mugs are of precisely equal quality.  The only difference in the mugs is their color.  Which would you rather buy?</p>

<p>…I think nearly every person would — if they had to make the choice — prefer to buy the blue coffee mug. Even if red is your favorite color and the red coffee mugs are so more stylish than blue ones, the thousand-fold difference in the price just doesn’t seem to cut it, and red wins out in a landslide.</p>

<p>Now why does this matter?  Because, I’d argue, the same kind of decisions are made when we donate, except most people make little effort to figure out which coffee mug is which.  And instead of the downside being wasting your own money on a coffee mug that is far too expensive, <strong>the downside of this mistake is that people die who otherwise wouldn’t have to.</strong>

    <p>Welcome to the second edition of Sunday Links!  These are links!  And this is posted on a Sunday!  Makes sense so far, right?  As a reminder, I may not agree with everything said in all of these links.</p>

<p>…Positional goods are things you spend money on solely to prove how rich you are.  For example, buying a $2000 watch that isn’t any better than a $100 one.  <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-moral-shortcomings-of-conspicuous-consumption-by-peter-singer">Peter Singer reminds us that such spending is somewhere between entirely wasteful and terribly evil</a>.  I wish more people could just go back to proving how rich they are by blowing it on ineffective philanthropy, because then it hopefully will take a lot less work to get them to channel it into effective philanthropy.</p>

<p>…In other Singer news, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEulhlGgskc">Peter Singer gives a talk about effective altruism</a>.  Luckily someone recorded it and put it on YouTube.  …Too many of these awesome lectures aren’t on YouTube.</p>

<p>….There’s <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2012/08/13/live-by-statistics-die-by-statistics/">something a little suspicious</a> about the p&lt;0.05 threshold.  Feel free to ignore this if you don’t know what “p&lt;0.05” means, but definitely read this if you do.  It’s for us statistics people.  Speaking of which, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/nobel-laureate-challenges-psychologists-to-clean-up-their-act-1.11535">psychology might be screwed</a> for similar reasons.
