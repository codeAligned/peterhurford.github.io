    <p>Imagine you came across a store offering the following options:</p>

<p><strong>Blue Coffee Mug:</strong> $1</p>

<p><strong>Red Coffee Mug:</strong> $1050</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>After thorough inspection, you discover that both mugs are of precisely equal quality.  The only difference in the mugs is their color.  Which would you rather buy?</p>

<p>…I think nearly every person would — if they had to make the choice — prefer to buy the blue coffee mug. Even if red is your favorite color and the red coffee mugs are so more stylish than blue ones, the thousand-fold difference in the price just doesn’t seem to cut it, and red wins out in a landslide.</p>

<p>Now why does this matter?  Because, I’d argue, the same kind of decisions are made when we donate, except most people make little effort to figure out which coffee mug is which.  And instead of the downside being wasting your own money on a coffee mug that is far too expensive, <strong>the downside of this mistake is that people die who otherwise wouldn’t have to.</strong>

    <p>Welcome to the second edition of Sunday Links!  These are links!  And this is posted on a Sunday!  Makes sense so far, right?  As a reminder, I may not agree with everything said in all of these links.</p>

<p>…Positional goods are things you spend money on solely to prove how rich you are.  For example, buying a $2000 watch that isn’t any better than a $100 one.  <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-moral-shortcomings-of-conspicuous-consumption-by-peter-singer">Peter Singer reminds us that such spending is somewhere between entirely wasteful and terribly evil</a>.  I wish more people could just go back to proving how rich they are by blowing it on ineffective philanthropy, because then it hopefully will take a lot less work to get them to channel it into effective philanthropy.</p>

<p>…In other Singer news, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEulhlGgskc">Peter Singer gives a talk about effective altruism</a>.  Luckily someone recorded it and put it on YouTube.  …Too many of these awesome lectures aren’t on YouTube.</p>

<p>….There’s <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2012/08/13/live-by-statistics-die-by-statistics/">something a little suspicious</a> about the p&lt;0.05 threshold.  Feel free to ignore this if you don’t know what “p&lt;0.05” means, but definitely read this if you do.  It’s for us statistics people.  Speaking of which, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/nobel-laureate-challenges-psychologists-to-clean-up-their-act-1.11535">psychology might be screwed</a> for similar reasons.

    <p>Many people think it would be nicer if people were to give more money to non-profits, especially effective ones.  However, for most people, it doesn’t even occur to them that they giving a large share of their salary to charity is something that people actually can do, or <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">that people are doing on a regular basis</a>.</p>

<p>Being public with one’s pledge to donate not only spreads information about how easy it is to fight global poverty with a serious commitment, but that such commitments are the kind of thing that people can actually take.  By being public with these pledges, we can actually inspire people to give, where they otherwise wouldn’t.</p>

<p>But how did people get stuck in a rut?  Why doesn’t giving money come naturally?  And how would public declarations help dig people out of this rut?

    <p>I’ve noticed that quite a few people are interested in fostering communities – both creating communities and improving them to make them work together.  But how do we go about actually doing this?  What’s there to community that we can foster and build upon?  What makes a community thrive, and how do we take advantage of this to make and/or improve communities?</p>

<p>To answer these questions, I turned to two books:</p>

<p>The first is <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385525761">The Penguin and The Leviathan: How Cooperation Triumphs Over Self-Interest</a></strong> by Yochai Benkler.  Benkler, in writing about cooperative systems (Penguins, named after the Linux Penguin) and hierarchical systems (Leviathans, named after Thomas Hobbes’s The Leviathan), studies the psychology, economics, and political science of cooperation and helps explain what makes communities stick.</p>

<p>The second is <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1118143302">Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive</a></strong> by Bruce Schneier.  Schneier studies trust and cooperation from a dizzying variety of sciences (psychology, biology, economics, anthropology, computer science, and political science).  Schneier’s ultimate game is figuring out what is preventing society from falling apart, and that can be applied to building communities.</p>

<p>Let’s see what they got.

    <p>As Peter Singer writes in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400067103"><strong>The Life You Can Save</strong></a>: “[t]he world would be a much simpler place if one could bring about social change merely by making a logically consistent moral argument”.  Many people one encounters might agree that a social change movement is noble yet not want to do anything to promote it, or want to give more money to a charity yet refrain from doing so.  Additional moralizing doesn’t seem to do the trick.  …So what does?</p>

<p>Motivating people to altruism is relevant for the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw(6).py/optimal_philanthropy_for_human_beings/">optimal philanthropy movement</a>.  For a start on the answer, like many things, I turn to psychology.  Specifically, the psychology Peter Singer catalogues in his book.
