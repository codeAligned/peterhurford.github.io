    <p>My <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/category/resolutions/">New Years Resolutions</a> have been greatly boosting my day-to-day behaviors so that I become the kind of person that has good diet, good fitness, and good productivity.  However, I’ve decided that I want to not just focus on my day-to-day, but my behaviors from “30,000 feet” or “year-to-year”, so to speak.  I want to set goals and be more strategic.</p>

<p>This is the essay where I do some goal setting for the next year.  Right now, I think I’ll commit to revising this plan every six months (November and May), but I reserve the right to change that.

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p><strong>Why blog?</strong>  In Harry Potter, Dumbledore stores his thoughts in a <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pensieve">pensieve</a>.  However, such magical technology already exists for us in a less awesome form: diaries and blogs.</p>

<p>The desire to blog nearly has always started with me feeling overwhelmed by having too many thoughts in my head.  I notice that I can’t think clearly, because focusing on one thought in particular ends up with me losing some of my other thoughts.  This creates a somewhat unpleasant feeling and loss of focus.</p>

<p>But the pensieve model brings a solution – I can make use of what has been called by certain academics as an “external memory field”, and by most nearly everyone else as “paper” or “word documents” to type up my thoughts.  Then, I can get rid of my thoughts from my (internal) mind and think without worry of loss.</p>

<p>Spencer Greenberg writes that <a href="http://www.spencergreenberg.com/2011/07/do-we-really-read-non-fiction-to-learn/">it’s rather pointless to try to read non-fiction with the intent to learn</a> unless you’re also taking notes, potentially doubling the effectiveness of your time spent reading or more.  Since I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-reading/">read a lot of books</a>, it would behoove me to summarize what I’ve read to make sure that I actually learn the material.</p>

<p>I can then come back to thoughts that I’ve stored days, weeks, months, or years older and retrieve them.  It’s really fun to read what I wrote a year ago and try to shift back into my old frame of mind.  Sometimes, old writing of mine is as unfamiliar to me as the writing of other people.

<p><a href="http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-right-to-remain-silent.html">Alonzo Fyfe says what I’ve been thinking</a> about whether it makes sense to have a “right to remain silent”.  Presumably, if the person is guilty, and they have some sort of evidence of their own guilt, than shouldn’t they ought to be compelled to provide that evidence, given that it helps put punish a guilty person?  The problems, then, are really in the nature of the coercion and whether this coercion would negatively effect innocent people enough as to be worth it.  But that seems better stopped by outlawing “cruel and unusual tactics” and regulating interrogation better.  To be clear, I’m not saying I don’t like the “right to remain silent”, just that I can’t currently make sense of it.</p>

    <p><strong>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/giving-now-currently-seems-to-beat-giving-later/">Giving Now Currently Seems To Beat Giving Later</a></strong></p>

<p>Thinking about <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">analyzing cost-effectiveness for vegetarian outreach</a>, has made me think more about where philanthropic dollars should go in order to do the most amount of good.  Most people just give to whatever charities come their way, send them advertisements, etc.  A lot of people are also concerned with giving back to their local community, supporting their church, or their university.</p>

<p>I don’t condemn any of those motivations – I think they’re wonderful, local communities do deserve support, and there’s something to be said for “paying it forward” and giving back to those who have set you up for success.  But I’m mostly concerned with what one should do with the goal to <a href="">improve the world as much as possible</a> (on the assumption that all interests count equally), and I’ve changed the way I think.

    <p>Among those people interested in doing as much as they can to make the world a better place and think donating their money as effectively as possible is a good way to do that, there is a debate about whether one should either (a) donate a specific portion of one’s income in small installments each year or (b) invest one’s income and then donate as much as possible in one large lump sum right before death.  Of course, there are other positions – like donate every month or donate every decade, but in a very relevant sense the debate is between two options: “give now” vs. “give later”.</p>

<p>In this essay, I will defend the “give now” camp and rebut the “give later” camp, thus explaining why I will continue to donate once a year, though think any sort of regular time period smaller than each year is probably also acceptable.
