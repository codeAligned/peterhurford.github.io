    <p>For-profit organizations (better known as <em>businesses</em>) are in many ways much more simple than non-profit organizations.  When it comes to a pizza place, their goal is to sell me a delicious cheese pizza for $12.95 and my goal is to find the most delicious cheese pizza I can with my $12.95.  When our goals overlap, I give them my money and they give me their pizza.</p>

<p><strong>For businesses, knowing you are successful is also easy</strong> – the critical metric of profit is hitting the business in the face every time the cash register opens, and it’s easy to document whether it’s going up or down.  We can tell if a business is successful just by looking at these numbers, and we have no need for <a href="http://denisonvpc.wordpress.com/2012/06/15/just-how-do-we-know-if-a-non-profit-is-effective-anyway/">randomized controlled trials</a> to see if making pizza is <em>really</em> the cause of profit, or if a pizza place could remain profitable without selling anything.</p>

<p><strong>Also for businesses, you are automatically accountable for failure.</strong>  In bigger companies, you get fired by your shareholders.  Or, you simply stop finding yourself having enough money to pay salaries and keep the place open.  If your product isn’t serving it’s customers, you quickly go out of business.  You don’t have to notice if you’re doing bad, because doing badly will just catch up with you.

    <p>Since living in Oxford, one of the centers of the “effective altruism” movement, I’ve been spending a lot of time discussing the classic “effective altruism” topic – where it would be best to focus our time and money.</p>

<p>Some people here seem to think that the most important thing we should be focusing our time and money on are speculative projects, or projects that promise a very high impact, but involve a lot of uncertainty.  One such very common example is “existential risk reduction”, or attempts to make a long-term far future for humans more likely, say by reducing the chance of things that would cause human extinction.</p>

<p>I do agree that the far future is the most important thing to consider, by far (see papers by <a href="http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf">Nick Bostrom</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research">Nick Beckstead</a>).  And I do think we can influence the far future.  I just don’t think we can do it in a <em>reliable</em> way.  All we have are guesses about what the far future will be like and guesses about how we can affect it. All of these ideas are unproven, speculative projects, and I don’t think they deserve the main focus of our funding.</p>

<p>While I waffled in cause indecision for a while, I’m now going to resume donating to <a href="http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell’s top charities</a>, except when I have an opportunity to use a donation to learn more about impact.  Why?  My case is that speculative causes, or any cause with high uncertainty (reducing nonhuman animal suffering, reducing existential risk, etc.) requires that we rely on our commonsense to evaluate them with naīve cost-effectiveness calculations, and this is (1) demonstrably unreliable with a bad track record, (2) plays right into common biases, and (3) doesn’t make sense based on how we ideally make decisions.  While it’s unclear what long-term impact a donation to a GiveWell top charity will have, the near-term benefit is quite clear and worth investing in.

    <p><a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/21/a-defense-of-logical-positivism-yes-really/">“A Defense of Logical Positivism (Yes, Really)”</a>.  I’ve always kind of thought like this.  Goes along with <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/k2/a_priori/">this take on a priori reasoning</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/awm/how_to_avoid_dying_in_a_car_crash/">“How to Avoid Dying in a Car Crash”</a>.  This is important, because it’s one of the highest causes of death for developed-world people aged 15-24, like me.  The tips?  (1) Don’t be overconfident; (2) don’t be distracted by phones, scenery, fatigue, or other passengers; (3) don’t speed; (4) avoid driving at night, during snow, or during rain; and the obvious stuff like (5) don’t drink alcohol and (6) wear your seatbelt.  Also… <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2012-09-23">car helmets</a>?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html">“Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas”</a> (about start-ups).  Generally, the problems are getting too excited and not putting in sufficient amount of time (i.e. weeks) in challenging the general idea behind your start-up, not wanting to do the un-fun parts of the job, and being too timid / risk-averse.</p>

<p>As Dan Gilbert points out <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html">in his TED Talk</a>, our beliefs about what will make us happy are often wrong.  It turns out we can adapt and find happiness in even some of the worst situations.  Hilarity ensues.</p>

<p>Value of information is important.  <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/85x/value_of_information_four_examples/">Here are four examples</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/08/the_importance_1.html">“The Importance of Security Engineering”</a>.  Also, should we pursue <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/03/security_awaren_1.html">security awareness training</a>?</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a>, of which I am a member, is a group that is united by taking a pledge to donate 10% of one’s income to seriously affect extreme poverty in the developing world.  However, donating is still widely considered an individual affair, despite criticism(1).</p>

<p>So why would people want to join together and make their giving public?  Because it turns out there is value in joining together and creating a community around a common cause.  In this essay, I will explore the benefits that members of a community get from associating with a group, specifically focusing on Giving What We Can.

    <p>Many people know about GiveWell and <a href="http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">their top-ranked charities</a>.  But how easy would it be to make a better one?  In <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/03/why-it-should-be-easy-to-dominate-givewells-recommendations.html">“Why It Should Be Easy to Dominate GiveWell’s Recommendations”</a>, Rob Wiblin notes the simple solution – fundraise for whatever organizations GiveWell recommends, and raise more than a dollar with each dollar you receive.</p>

<p>Organizations themselves <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising">are wary of fundraising</a>, mainly because spending a lot of resources on fundraising messes with their “overhead ratio” or percentage of funds spent directly on the mission.  Even if an organization could achieve gains through fundraising, it’s outweighed by “looking bad”.  So ideally, we’d need other people to come together and create an organization that does full-time fundraising for other organizations.</p>

<p>Luckily, an organization has been founded to do just that.  Joey Savoie, Xiomara Kikauka, and Lucas Zamprogno have come together to create <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/">Effective Fundraising</a> an organization that provides free fundraising to charities with a proven track record of effectiveness, as ranked by <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>, or <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org">Effective Animal Activism</a>.  Currently, <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/our-charity-choice.html">they’re fundraising for</a> both the <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.thehumaneleague.com/">The Humane League</a>, both of which don’t do any grant fundraising themselves.</p>

<p>Not only that, but they fundraise using the most effective methods that has been proven by studies – grant writing and high net worth fundraising.  The <a href="http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/research/fundratios/">UK Institute of Fundraising</a> estimates that grant writing returns, on average, $7 for every $1 invested and focusing on high net worth giving can get average returns of $4 for every $1 invested.  <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0471320145">Fund Raising: Evaluating and Managing the Fund Development Process</a></strong> states that these two are the highest return fundraising campaigns, with a return of $10 and $5 per $1 invested respectively.</p>

<p>You can read more about <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/07/our-values.html">their values</a>, <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/07/our-epistemology.html">their epistemology</a>, and <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/07/our-strategy.html">strategy</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/05/why-fundraising.html">why they’re interested in fundraising</a> on <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/">their website</a>.</p>

<p>They’re still in the “proof of concept” phase and are not currently actively seeking funding, but they seem like a promising opportunity to keep an eye on for the future.</p>
