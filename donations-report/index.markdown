I think that philanthropy is one of the best ways to make the world better, especially when done with an aim to be as effective as possible. Inspired by [Jeff Kaufman's donation report](http://www.jefftk.com/donations), I also want to bring more transparency to my advocacy for utilitarianism and philanthropy.

On 31 Dec 11, I first decided I should start donating, and started with $20.  Then, in April, I decided to be "serious" about it, and give 10% of my pre-tax income.  Of course, it's only a meager college kid's income, but everyone has to start somewhere.  As of 28 Nov 12, I've been donating 20% of everything I earn pre-tax above $2400.  

Here's where that money has been going.  Why these places?  See ["Where I'm Giving and Why?"](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-im-giving-and-why/).
