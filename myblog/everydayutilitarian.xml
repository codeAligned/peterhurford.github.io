		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most of my reading is on the internet, but I do also like to read offline paper books.  So I've decided to keep a list, starting from the beginning of July 2011, and documenting all the books that I've read, the book I'm currently reading, and all the books I plan to read.

Eventually, if I get around to it, I also plan to write blog posts reviewing all the books on this list that I've read.  But that goal may be too lofty.  I don't read books very fast, and I review them even slower...  Time will tell.

If you have any suggestions for books to read, feel free to recommend some in the comments section!
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Also,
[GOT] means that I personally own the book.
[GETTING] means I am in the process of getting the book and have it taken care of.
[LIB] means the book is available to me via my university library.
[LIB-GOT] means that I have the book checked out from my university library.
[NEED] means that I need to buy the book.  <i>(See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/161R3VB6T2YLZ/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_ws_e2hQqb04FNPEY">all of these in my Amazon Wishlist</a> if you're looking for gift ideas for me!)</i>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This comment/Question isn't pertaining to the blogs on this page.  I've had a hard time trying to ask a question about some pictures that I've had for almost 15 years now.  I noticed that someone else had purchased some of Coolidge's Poker Dog  paintings.  Mine look like they were copied or printed from a press of some kind because the paper is slick like photo paper but not quite as thick as photo paper.  My question is, how can I find out if my pictures are of any monitary value or if I just have copies that were mass produced from the year "2005". My Poker Dog pictures are: Post Mortem &amp; His station and Four Aces. I would also like to know if I can obtain a letter of authenticity if these are collectors items.  I appreciate any insite you can help me find out.  I look forward to your reply.  Thanks so much for your time.  Lynn Turner (larenrut@gmail.com)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I found this site through your previous blog, specifically a post explaining why infinity is not a number.  Your approach was very methodical and addressed what can easily become a very convoluted, math-centric problem in clear language.  I'm a graduate student (classical physics), taking a year to focus on pure mathematics before returning to my dissertation but have always enjoyed epistemology as it pertains to both science and religion.  While I'm working through the body of posts, I would very much enjoy a dialog on the subject if you've the time and interest.

Best,
J. Sanders]]></wp:comment_content>

				<title>Donations Report</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I think that philanthropy is one of the best ways to make the world better, especially when done with an aim to be as effective as possible. Inspired by <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/donations">Jeff Kaufman's donation report</a>, I also want to bring more transparency to my advocacy for utilitarianism and philanthropy.

On 31 Dec 11, I first decided I should start donating, and started with $20.  Then, in April, I decided to be "serious" about it, and give 10% of my pre-tax income.  Of course, it's only a meager college kid's income, but everyone has to start somewhere.  As of 28 Nov 12, I've been donating 20% of everything I earn pre-tax above $2400.  

Here's where that money has been going.  Why these places?  See <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-im-giving-and-why/">"Where I'm Giving and Why?"</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Direct Continuation of: <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/what-is-peter-reading">What is Peter Reading?</a></b>

Since July 1, 2011, I've been cataloging and rating all the books I have read.  Now that this list is getting a bit long, I'd like to embark on a slightly more ambitious project -- not only rating them, but also reviewing them, and writing summaries of the books I like (or linking to other summaries/reviews).

And perhaps further, you're willing to <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/the-pledge">give a good portion of money</a> and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">give effectively</a>, aiming it at <a href="http://80000hours.org/causes">some</a> <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities">particularly</a> <a href="http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">effective</a> <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/">organizations</a>.  But should you give your donation to one organization, or should you aim to spread it around?

The common wisdom is that you should spread it around, giving to whichever organizations you like and want to show support for.  Generally, people who accept this common wisdom are unconcerned with effectiveness, and give mostly to help their local community.  In doing so, lot's of organizations get help.

The wisdom among those interested in effectiveness, however, is to only give to one organization.  Why?  Economist Steven Landsburg explains in <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/everyday_economics/1997/01/giving_your_all.html">"Giving Your All"</a> that when you identify the most effective organization, it's likely you won't donate enough for marginal returns to lower enough to make it not as effective as your runner up.  Donating to a second organization means donating to a less effective organization, and that would be bad.

However, I think there's a significantly less naïve argument for splitting donations, based on the <i>indirect impact</i> of a donation, in addition to it's <i>direct impact</i>.  Sure, any donation you make is directly funding hopefully worthwhile and effective activities.  <b>But it's also doing other things</b>, such as allowing the organization the ability to learn how to improve, giving us more information about giving opportunities, buying you further access to the organization, and changing incentives -- <b>and these indirect effects favor splitting at least some of your donation up to multiple organizations.</b><!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Room for More Funding</h2>
One consideration when donating is <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/scalability">room for more funding</a>, or whether your <i>additional</i> donation will cause <i>additional</i> effective activities to take place that wouldn't have happened without your donation.  The idea is that organizations can only process and put money into action so quickly that even the most effective organization could be in a position where it can't (yet) make use of additional money in an effective way.

Room for more funding is one example of an indirect effect that could make you want to split your donation -- if you donate <i>so much</i> to the organization that they run out of funding, your additional giving should be placed elsewhere.  However, GiveWell currently estimates that their #1 non-profit, <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, could <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Roomformorefunds">absorb up to $67 million</a> (upper bound), so unless you're a billionaire, you probably won't need to worry about this.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Giving to Learn</h2>
GiveWell mentions that one of <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/20/near-term-grantmaking/">the reasons they make grants</a> is to "give to learn", or use philanthropy in order to acquire more information and make future money more effective.  As GiveWell writes:

<blockquote>In some cases a grant can be viewed as an “experiment” – a way to test a theory that a particular project will have a particular result, or will more generally be a worthwhile investment. [...Though, i]n our experience, understanding the outcomes/results of a given philanthropic project is usually a major undertaking, and it’s easy to learn nothing from a grant if one does not commit to such an undertaking.  Therefore, we try to pick “learning grants” of this type carefully.</blockquote>

When a donation is used, not only does the direct impact take place, but the organization itself learns a little bit about how they operate and can improve.  (Though, note that often non-profits can <a href="">be disconnected from their actual impact</a>, and thus often could learn <i>nothing</i>.)  Furthermore, donors can be in a position to learn as well, by seeing if their donation produces the intended outcomes.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Buying Access</h2>
* Learning
* Influence

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Incentive Effects</h2>
* We want orgs to care about being #2

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reasons Not to Spread Your Donation</h2>
* Processing fees
* Differences in direct impact could be very large

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Giving to Africa accomplishes nothing.  All the aid is squandered by corrupt bureaucrats.</b>

<b>But giving still accomplishes litte, because the organizations squander it on overhead.</b>
imagine an org with no overhead - no electricity, volunteer flashlights, etc.

<b>If I really want to help someone, I'm better off giving the money directly to a homeless person.</b>

<b>But look how much we spend on foreign aid!  Surely if it were effective, problems would have been solved by now.</b>
1.) Aid isn't that much + wrong guesses about aid
2.) Problems have been solved

<b>I don't know much about the problems in Africa.  I don't want to be a "white in shining armor".  But I do know about the problems in my home town, so I'm going to help here.  Charity starts at home, right?</b>

<b>But morality isn't about giving to the third world.  It's about being a good person and upholding virtue.</b>

<b>I like my own local community better.  I want to give back.  Why shouldn't I just donate locally?</b>

<b>You can't save a life.  If I give a person an anti-malaria bednet, they'll just die of another disease in a few months, right?</b>

<b>But really, you can't save a life.  Everyone will die eventually.  So what's the point?</b>

<b>Okay, so maybe I'd be happy to "extend lives" or "save lives" or whatever you want to call it.  But all that will do is cause overpopulation, and that will lead to a whole host of other problems.</b>

<b>Shouldn't we be attacking "root causes" and not mere symptoms?</b>

<b>Giving to the third world is fine, but if we're taking this long-term view, aren't there even better opportunities?</b>

<b>Aid will just breed dependency.</b>

<b>I have a right to keep my own money.  I worked hard for it.  Why should I give it to other people who haven't worked hard for it?</b>

<b>The problem is too large.  I can't dent it.</b>

<b>Ok, so maybe I'm making some sort of dent.  But how can I know?  The problem is so large, I can't see my impact.  How do we know we're doing good?</b>

<b>We don't need aid.  We need political reform.  It's the system that's bringing us down.  In fact, philanthropy makes it harder to bring about this reform.</b>

<b>Giving personally is a needlessly conservative idea that ignores the benefits of public coordination and reform.</b> 

<b>I don't earn enough money to afford to give to charity.</b>

<b>If everyone gave all their money, the economy would collapse.</b>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Follow up to: <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/the-true-fear-of-being-wrong">The True Fear of Being Wrong</a></b>

From <a href="">utilitarianism</a> to <a href="">large amounts of donations</a> to <a href="">vegetarianism</a> to <a href="">existential risk</a> to <a href="">concern for wild animal suffering</a>, I advocate for a lot of ideas that are considered "out there".  Some people might even consider these views "crazy".

I'm a bit concerned about having these "crazy" ideas and talking about them openly.  Sometimes, I don't talk about them in person out of these concerns, even when I think advocating for them would otherwise have high value.  But what am I afraid of?<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actually Being Crazy</h2>
I suppose the first reason is that having "crazy" ideas might mean that I actually <i>am</i> crazy.  After all, crazy people don't know they're crazy.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>People Won't Accept My More Mainstream Ideas Because I'm Seen as Crazy</h2>

				<title>But Really, Can Money Buy You Happiness?</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/?p=722</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's something of folk wisdom that "money can't buy happiness".  However, like most folk wisdom, it has been shattered through scientific analysis.  Or has it?  The problem is that there has been a lot of attention to the connection between how much money one has and how happy they are, and different investigation comes to slightly different conclusions.

But why might this be the case?  I decided I was confused enough about the relationship between money and happiness that I wanted to look at all these studies and try and get to the bottom of things.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Correlates with Happiness?</h2>
One thing that is clear is if money has some correlation with happiness, it's one correlate among many.  Interestingly and perhaps frustratingly, ones genes account for 38%[A] to to 80%[B] of the variation between happiness among people, with most studies settling on 50%[C].  This indicates that there is a "baseline" happiness that people tend to revert to over time[D]

A: Stubbe, J. H., D. Posthuma, D. L. Boomsma, and E. J. C. DeGues. 2005. <a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Stubbe-Heritability-of-life-satisfaction-in-adults-A-twin-family-study.pdf">Heritability of Life Satisfaction in Adults: a Twin-Family Study</a>. <i>Psychological Medicine</i> 35: 1581-1588.

B: Lykken, D. and A. Tellegen. 1996. <a href="http://www.psych.umn.edu/psylabs/happness/happy.htm">"Happiness is a Stochastic Phenomenon"</a>. <i>Psychological Science</i> 7: 186-189.

C:

DeFries, & Fulker, 1992; Tellegen et al., 1988; cf. Diener et al., 1999

Factors that correlate moderately with happiness include: health,13 social activity,14 and religiosity.15 Factors that correlate strongly with happiness include: genetics,16 love and relationship satisfaction,17 and work satisfaction.18

13 Those with disabling health conditions are happier than you might think (Myers 1992; Riis et al. 2005; Argyle 1999).

14 Those who are satisfied with their social life are moderately more happy than others (Diener & Seligman 2004; Myers 1999; Diener & Seligman 2002).

15 Religiosity correlates with happiness (Abdel-Kahlek 2005; Myers 2008), though it may be religious attendance and not religious belief that matters (Chida et al. 2009).

16 Past happiness is the best predictor of future happiness (Lucas & Diener 2008). Happiness is surprisingly unmoved by external factors (Lykken & Tellegen 1996), because genes accounts for about 50% of the variance in happiness (Lyubomirsky et al. 2005; Stubbe et al. 2005).

17 Married people are happier than those who are single or divorced (Myers & Diener 1995; Diener et al. 2000), and marital satisfaction predicts happiness (Proulx et al. 2007).

18 Unemployment makes people very unhappy (Argyle 2001), and job satisfaction is strongly correlated with happiness (Judge & Klinger 2008; Warr 1999).

				<title>X Non-Obvious Rules I (Try to) Live By</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Personal rules are important for life.  Some people talk about the difference between <a href="">shoulds and musts</a>, and highlight musts as more effective for creating personal change.  While I'm not perfect, trying to adhere to all these rules has made me much happier, much healthier, less stressed, and more productive.

I've left off the obvious rules like don't murder.  I'm not saying these rules are right or even saying that you ought to follow them, but I offer these rules to learn more about me and perhaps maybe inspire yourself to have some rules.  Perhaps you already have some rules of your own.  If you do, I encourage you to write them down (Rule #X).

<ol>
<li>I will be the person I want to be.</li>
<li>I will always seek to follow the rules that allow me to maximize happiness and minimize suffering.  I will be thankful that I have identified what I want to do so early in life.</li>
<li>I will <a href="">live frugally</a> and work to <a href="">donate as much excess money as I can</a> to <a href="">the most effective charities I can find</a>, knowing <a href="">this money will mean so much more to others than it will to me</a> and that there's <a href="">large differences in the value each dollar will have depending on where it goes</a>.  I will remember that this frugality is not a sacrifice, but rather <a href="">a path to a meaningful life</a>.
<li>I will work no less than an average of ten hours a day, because I have important things to do and I have found work I enjoy.  I will <a href="">use a significant portion of this work-time to benefit the less fortunate</a>.</li>
<li>I will work no more than an average of twelve hours a day, because overwork can lead to dangerous burnout.  Social time is also very important, both for its own sake and for the sake of improving work time.</li>
<li>I will never eat meat and I will avoid eating eggs.</li>
<li>I will follow a healthy diet that gets me all the nutrition I need, as much as possible.</li>
<li>I will only eat unhealthy snacks on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and holidays.</li>
<li>I will exercise <a href="">with weights</a> when possible (and <a href="">bodyweights</a> when not possible) every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.  I will run every Saturday.</li>
<li>I will not lie.</li>
<li>I will avoid multitasking.</li>
<li>I will write things down when I can.</li>
<li>I will go to bed early.  I aim to get in bed by 9:30p or 10p as much as I can, though I stay up late for social reasons once a week.</li>
<li>I will <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/segmented-sleep/">segment my sleep</a>.  This is weird, so I don't usually talk about it.  But it feels a lot more restful, is allegedly healthier, and lets me get away with sleeping a little bit less.  I also try to add a midday nap, either <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/dual-core/">to a segmented sleep schedule</a> or a <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/siesta/">regular sleep schedule</a>.</li>
<li>I will consume caffeine rarely; only when I'm trying to stay up very late for important social reasons.  I make sure to avoid drinking caffeine within eight hours of my bed time.</li>
<li>I will create a to-do list at the end of each day and follow it at the start of the next day.  I <a href="">follow all my own advice on productivity</a>.</li>

				<title>Personal Review for Dec 2012 - Feb 2013</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/?p=1237</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2014 00:45:14 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/a-year-of-mostly-new-years-resolutions/">"A Year of Mostly New Years Resolutions"</a> and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/six-month-review-ii-june-november-2013/">"Six Month Review II: June-November 2013"</a>.</i>

Every month for all of 2013, I reviewed how my life was going.  I also punctuated this with two six-month reviews, where I focused on longer-term goals.  This year, I find both of those review cycles not working very well for me.  While I still find reviewing each day, week, and month useful, I don't find it useful to write about them.  Instead, I want to write in order to reflect upon my goals.  However, I don't want to wait <i>six months</i> to do a six-month review.  I think I have useful things to say now based on what I have collected.  So one month is too fast.  Six months is too slow.  So now we're at a compromise where my only public self-reviews (and only lengthy ones -- the others all don't involve writing anymore) will be three month reviews.

So now I'll do a little write up for each of my goals, do some analysis, and then come away with new goals for the next three months.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goal #1: Thinking Through Complex Issues</h2>
I have certain questions that I find important.  I want to blog through them, here.

<b>"What should I do when I graduate?"</b> ...

<b>"What normative framework should I choose?"</b> ...

<b>"What would someone acting out utilitarianism in their everyday life look like?"</b> ...

<b>"How, if at all, can utilitarianism be presented as a robust moral theory?"</b> ...

<b>"What causes should a utilitarian focus on?"</b> ...

<b>"How, if at all, should I change my lifestyle?"</b> ...

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goal #2: Do Projects Related to Effective Altruism</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goal #3: Make Denison a Better Place</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goal #4: Talk to Cool People</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goal #5: Evaluate Time Spent</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goal #6: Stabilize Sleep</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goal #7: Be Stricter about Diet and Exercise</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goal #8: Increase Lifts</h2>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i><b>Note:</b> This essay originally appeared on my previous blog, <a href="http://www.greatplay.net">Greatplay.net</a>, and has been moved here. As such, it links back to essays on the original blog.</i>

I've come to realize that a large portion of habit formation (at least for me) is <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/in-giving-it-pays-to-precommit">publicly pre-committing</a> to things. I've also come to realize that blogs are generally more interesting when you get to learn more about the personal life of the person who writes them. These two realizations join in one place: blogging about my New Years Resolutions.

First, a note about my type of goal-setting -- as you've perhaps seen with my other public goals (<a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/the-nanowrimo-2011-experiment">NaNoWriMo 2011</a>, <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/the-sort-of-nanowrimo-experiment-sort-of-redux-extravaganza-2012">NaNoWriMo 2012</a>, and <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/a-blogging-experiment">blogging</a> <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/back-for-a-third-blogxperiment">schedules</a>), I tend to be optimistic and ambitious, to the point where I can sometimes set myself up for failure.<!--more-->

&nbsp;
<h2>Blog</h2>
I like blogging, and I think blogging does a lot for me in being able to clear and organize my thoughts, and to communicate and advocate my point of view. Therefore, I want to write better. However, I don't know how to measure the quality of my writing, so I'm unsure how to resolve to write better.

There's a way out. I've found that my subjective feelings of quality of writing and the objective indicators I do have (number of comments, quality of comments, positivity and frequency of simple feedback) all seem to go up when I write <i>more</i>. In the same spirit of NaNoWriMo, quantity seems to bring a quality all of its own.

Therefore, In 2009, I wrote 80 essays. In 2010, I wrote 24. In 2011, I jumped back up to 139. In 2012, I finished 184. This year, I want to shoot even higher, and aim for 200 essays in 2013.

I'm also re-discovering that I enjoy computer programming and my <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/arcade">games arcade</a> is a little bare. I therefore resolve to add 4 more games to the arcade. I hope this will bring a bit more variety to the site.

&nbsp;
<h2>Health</h2>
But my resolutions aren't just about this blog. I'd also like to improve my health. Most mundanely, I've been having some trouble getting into the habit of brushing my teeth regularly. I'd like to fix that.

Also, at 6 foot 2 inches and 210 pounds, I am slightly overweight. As far as I've come to understand, 99% of weight loss involves eating less and exercising more. An additional 0.9% involves eating better. (But you probably shouldn't take weight loss advice from undergraduates with no specialized knowledge or training, especially if they're still overweight.)

&nbsp;
<h4>No S Diet</h4>
First, as for the eating less and eating better, I'd like to start what's called the <a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/">No S Diet</a>:
<blockquote><span>The No S Diet [...] is a program of systematic moderation I invented for myself that I imagine might work for similarly minded people. No funny science or calorie accounting involved, just a few simple and mnemonic tricks for building sustainably "good enough" eating habits. There are just three rules and one exception: No Snacks, No Sweets, No Seconds, Except (sometimes) on days that start with "S". That's it.</span></blockquote>
The upshot of this is exactly what it says on the tin: On weekdays and non-holidays, I will eat no snacks (I will confine myself to three meals a day), no sweets (I'm not eating candy, baked goods, syrup, ice cream, sodas, fruit juices, or sugary cereal), and no seconds (whatever I eat for my meals must fit on one plate).

And while it doesn't fit the mnemonic, I'd like to add another part to this -- no caffeine. I seem to sleep better and more regularly without it, so I'd rather just avoid it along with the rest, even if it will take a similar amount of resistance. At this rate, given that I already don't drink alcohol, the only thing between me and Mormonism is the belief system... most of the behavior change would be easy. (I also <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/why-vegetarianism">refrain from eating meat</a>, so I'm no stranger to dietary restrictions, even those that don't have weekend breaks.)

&nbsp;
<h4>Exercise</h4>
Second, while I have been running during last summer, I've been out of practice since school started. I'd like to restart, by completing the nine-week <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml">Complete Couch to 5k</a>. (I had gotten to 1.7km earlier, but now I'm securely back at couch.) Each week installment requires three days a week, so I will commit to that. I'm going to give myself some extra leeway starting this one out, however, because not only am I not used to making a school schedule to accomodate running, but also because it's cold outside and I've never run in the winter before.

I'd also like to supplement the running with work on the <a href="http://www.hundredpushups.com/">Hundred Pushups</a> routine and the <a href="http://www.twohundredsitups.com/">Two Hundred Situps</a> routine. My initial test was 9 push-ups and 25 sit-ups. These are seven-week routines, three days a week. I will do my pushups and situps on the same day, but might not do them on the same days as Couch to 5k, though each will be three days a week.

I think that's good enough for now. Assuming I actually stick with these regimens and improve enough to meet their fitness requirements, I can start browsing for more advanced routines, or try and craft my own. More likely I'll plateau somewhere for quite a few weeks, assuming I even stick with it.

&nbsp;
<h2>Finances</h2>
Additionally, I'd like to focus on my finances. I already live a pretty frugal life. But I still spend money on things I don't need. And not even in the utilitarian sense of <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/charity-how-much-should-i-give">my money is always better spent on other people</a>. While I would like to be frugal so I can afford to donate more, I'd also like to be more frugal so I can <i>save</i> more, and also because I think that I could just generally buy the same amount of personal happiness for less. I could easily be more cost-effective.

In 2012 currently have spent about $2400 on everything, excluding taxes, donations, and what my parents buy for me (college meal plan, textbooks, housing, tuition, insurance, web hosting fees, cell phone data plan, and some other miscellaneous essential expenses).

However, I've been reading a lot of stuff over at <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr. Money Mustache</a>, <a href="http://earlyretirementextreme.com/">Early Retirement Extreme</a>, and <a href="http://yboris.com/frugal.php">Boris's Frugality Guide</a>, and I'm rather certain I can make a goal to slash this to about $2000 and be no less happy.

I'd also like to earn more, so I can do more things. I earned about $6000 through various jobs and stipends throughout 2012. I'd like to bring this up to over $6200.

&nbsp;
<h2>Driving</h2>
Also on the somewhat embarrassing front, I'm 21 and have never gotten a driving license, which is unusual for people of my age where I live. I've learned how to drive somewhat before on a learner's temporary permit, but it expired and then I went to college and never needed to know how to drive again. As an investment in my future, in case of the very likely event I will have to drive at some point, I want to get my license. I got a new temporary permit on 28/Dec/12, but now I need to re-learn how to drive and pass the driving test to get an actual license.

&nbsp;
<h2>Some Notes on Habit Formation</h2>
But how am I going to make these habits stick? Well, specific, measurable, and trackable precommitments are the first step. Making those precommitments public and out in the open, so other people can hold me accountable, is another step.

The third step is to <i>actually</i> track and measure those precommitments (in a public way), so I'm announcing a new project -- tracking my habits in a <a href="http://everydaysystems.com/habitcal/view/?o=7891">HabitCal</a>, which "is a free online tool for tracking (and more importantly, building) good habits -- like diet and exercise" from the same guy who made the No S Diet.

The fourth step was to make the habits psychology safe -- they're ambitious, but they're within current projections, are "doable", and have escape clauses (like exercising only three days a week on any three days instead of specific ones, or being off the diet on weekends). They're also not overly time consuming or require that much mental energy -- the diet is simple, the workouts start at 35 minutes per week and scales up to 1 hour a week. ...And it's a lot easier to avoid snacks or seconds if you don't have any in your room and couldn't eat them even if you wanted to.

And the fifth and final step is that I'm actually committed to these precommitments. These are things I want to do.

The sixth step would be to find friends who want to make similar resolutions, and then check up on each other. But I haven't found any yet. Are you interested?

Besides all that, I can find surprisingly little immediate information about habit formation that is reliable and on the internet. Maybe I'll have to search JStor or books?

Well, most importantly, let's see if I actually keep these habits.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i><b>Note:</b> This essay originally appeared on my previous blog, <a href="http://www.greatplay.net">Greatplay.net</a>, and has been moved here.</i>

<b>Follow up to: <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions">New Years Resolutions</a></b>

On 2 Jan, I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions">outlined my New Years Resolutions</a> for this year.  I also made sure to publicly commit to these resolutions, since public commitment is a powerful tool to build habits.  But it wouldn't work if I announced it once and then never talked about it again.  Additionally, as time goes on, I learn more about how things are going and decide to update my resolutions.  Therefore, I'm aiming to provide monthly updates on my progress.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Blogging Goal Update</h2>
My first resolution dealt with blogging quantity -- specifically, I wanted to have published 200 essays from 1 Jan 2013 to 31 Dec 2013. For those keeping score at home, with this essay, it is 4 Feb, and I have published 22 essays.  That means I have accomplished 11% of my goal within 35 days, which is 9.5% of my allotted time.  At this rate of 4.4 essays per week, I will meet my goal on 15 Nov.  Though I do anticipate slowing down sometime in the near future, as you saw, I already had to take a one-week break.

My second goal was to add four more games to <a href="http://www.peterhurford.com/stuff.html">the arcade</a>.  I have plans for what all four games would entail.  None of them, however, are near completion, though I'd say that three of them are half-made and the last one is started.  I’m also re-discovering that I enjoy computer programming and my games arcade is a little bare. I therefore resolve to add 4 more games to the arcade. I hope this will bring a bit more variety to the site.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Diet Updates</h2>
My second commitment was to better my diet by committing myself to the <a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/">No S Diet</a>.  That's the one where "[t]here are just three rules and one exception: No Snacks, No Sweets, No Seconds, Except (sometimes) on days that start with 'S'. That’s it."

I've never failed at it, though I have come close, and I have done one "wait for Friday to end and eat candy right at midnight" kind of deal.  I've also made exceptions on quite a few non-weekend days in order to sample my girlfriend's lovely baking abilities and took another special exception to energize myself for Moot Court Nationals.

Overall, I think it's going pretty well.  My only regrets are that (1) non-sugar cereal tastes very bland, especially when repeated morning after morning, even if I do add banana slices and (2) I can still occasionally get pretty hungry without a snack sometimes.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Exercise Updates</h2>
My third commitment was to exercise, which you can see on my special <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-is-peter-exercising">exercise log</a>.  I've been doing fairly well at keeping up with it, though I've been changing the nature of the exercise a fair bit.

I started out wanting to do <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml">The Couch To 5K</a> running plan, the <a href="http://www.hundredpushups.com/#sthash.oy6Cm6ax.dpbs">One Hundred Pushups Plan</a>, and the <a href="http://www.twohundredsitups.com/">Two Hundred Sit-Ups Plan</a>.  I ended up quitting all of these after about four weeks.

Instead, I do something different.  For running, I haven't deviated that much.  My goal is still to be able to soon run a 5K, like the Couch to 5K plan goes.  The difference is that I've just plotted a 5k route and made goals to complete it in ever decreasing amounts of time.  Currently, I can run about the first mile of it, then walk/run the rest, completing it now in about 38 minutes.  I hope to bring this time down pretty soon.  I'd be pretty excited if I can just run all of it without stopping, especially if I got a sub-30 minute completion time.

As for the non-cardio component of the exercise routine, I've just been doing a personalized "circuit" of exercises designed to give a full body work-out, following Mount Holyoke's Athletic Training <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_D_IjuAUl8">"No Excuses Workout"</a> [YouTube] that my girlfriend, a Mount Holyoke student, referred me to.  You can see <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/my-circuit-exercises">my customization and progress on the circuit here</a>.

The cardio happens Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.  The circuit happens Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, unless it's snowing or raining bad outside and then I'll switch cardio for the circuit.  Sunday is my rest day.  I'm going to keep this up for another four weeks or so, and then re-evaluate the program.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Driving Updates</h2>
Practicing driving went pretty well over Winter Break.  I got in more than twenty hours behind the wheel.  Now that I'm at college, it's a bit harder to practice, but I intend to schedule a driving test soon.  It's my goal to have my license by the time of the next update.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finances Updates</h2>
Another rocky road is meeting my finances goal.  My goals here were two-fold: (1) spend only $2000 this year without sacrificing happiness or forsaking friends and (2) earn $6200 without sacrificing any long-term future plans.  Since I can't forecast the future from 1 Jan, it was clear this goal would have a lot of uncertainty.  Spending seems to be going fine, though I don't know what expenses I'll encounter this summer.

The $6200 income goal is going to be quite a stretch though, since so far I've earned only $51 and have no real stable source of income yet.  I've been searching for a regular campus job with little success.  My initial plan for a summer income didn't work out with my other obligations.  This goal might easily fail for reasons outside of my control, though I'll try to handle what I can control and do my best.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hygiene Updates</h2>
Not everything has been perfect, though.  Consider remembering to brush my teeth and floss twice a day.  There are two exemptions from the times I ran out of toothpaste and floss respectively.  There are 27 successes.  However, there are also eight failures.  I think the reason this one is rough is it hits me right when I'm sleepiest -- waking up and going to bed.  I'm still doing much better than I've ever done before and think I'm currently going strong, but I might have to get more creative on this one.  In fact...

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Bet</h2>
What would be an update without a little bit of taking things to the next level?  Specifically to get a little creative, I have made a friendly wager with my friend, Eric "Harry" Brisson.  For the period of 9 Feb - 9 Mar, if I have any less than 95% success (aka any more than 1 failure) in any of my three HabitCal categories (exercise, diet, and hygiene), I owe him $20.

On the flipside, if he fails to update his blog, <a href="http://listentobrisson.com/">Listen to Brisson</a>, at least once per week during that interval, he will give me one half of one day's wage for him.

...I've never had a strong financial incentive to ruin someone's blogging career before.

<b>Follow up to: <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/resolutions-update-february-edition">Resolution Update - February Edition</a></b>

On 2 Jan, I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions">outlined my New Years Resolutions</a> for this year. I also made sure to publicly commit to these resolutions, since public commitment is a powerful tool to build habits. But it wouldn’t work if I announced it once and then never talked about it again. Additionally, as time goes on, I learn more about how things are going and decide to update my resolutions. Therefore, I’m aiming to provide monthly updates on my progress.  Here's the one for March, following the one <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/resolutions-update-february-edition">from February</a>.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Blogging Update</h2>
<b>Goal #1:</b> Publish 200 essays from 1 Jan 2013 to 31 Dec 2013.
<b>Progress as of 4 Feb:</b> 22 essays (11% of goal in 9.5% of allotted time).
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> 38 essays (19% of goal in 19.1% of allotted time).

<b>Commentary:</b> It's pretty clear that I'm slowing down a bit, especially with my most recent week off, but I'm still keeping even with the goal and have barely fallen behind.  Once <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/announcing-den-con-2013">Den Con</a> is over and especially once school is over, I expect this pace to be able to pick up significantly.

<b>Goal #2:</b> Add four games to the <a href="peterhurford.com/stuff.html">arcade</a> by 31 Dec 2013.
<b>Progress as of 4 Feb:</b> Three games are half-made and the last one is started.
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> No change.

<b>Commentary:</b> I don't expect to have all that much time to make significant progress on this until school is out, though I could probably do some stuff over Spring Break.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Diet Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #3:</b> Follow the <a href="nosdiet.com">No S Diet</a> -- No Snacks, No Sweets, No Seconds, Except (sometimes) on days that start with "S".
<b>Progress as of 4 Feb:</b> 100% Success
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> 90.9% Success for 4 Feb - 10 Mar; 95.3% Overall Success

<b>Commentary:</b> So there was two days that I broke the diet.  But it actually wasn't a failure of willpower.  Instead, for both times, it was that it was Sunday and I simply forgot that I was exempting myself from the diet on Friday and Saturday rather than the default Saturday and Sunday.  Oops.  But the most minor of breaches is still a breach and I wanted to document it.  To fix this problem, I've written down on my calendar specifically which days correspond with which habits I'm seeking to cultivate.

The reason I changed from Saturday/Sunday to Friday/Saturday is to accomodate days where people offer me snacks and I feel weird or rude turning them down.  It helped for a little bit, but it didn't really cover all the bases.  So what I'm going to do instead is add the following rule: "If someone offers me a snack, I may accept it in the most minimal amount that is socially respectable, but I may not abuse this rule by initiating the other person's offering."

Another change I'm going to make is a bit of tweaks to the idea of what counts as a "sweet".  Previously, I had been avoiding Raisin Bran cereal and Chocolate Milk.  I'm going to put both of those back in, but restrict myself to only one bowl or cup of them a day (except on Friday/Saturday/Holidays).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Exercise Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #4:</b> Commit to vaguely exercising.
<b>Progress as of 4 Feb:</b> 95.7% Success
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> 87.5% Success for 4 Feb - 10 Mar, 91.7% Overall Success

<b>Commentary:</b> More specifically, I've defined my exercise goal as exercising five times a week (not Wednesday or Saturday) for at least twenty minutes, either doing circuit exercises or running.  I'm trying to be able to run a 5K without needing to stop to walk, and I've recently been really close (getting up to 2.7mi).  Recently, however, a minor leg injury prevented me for running for one week and then falling sick prevented me from running for another week, so I've definitely fallen behind and will have to work back up to the 2.7.

I've also had the classic problem of occasionally not being able to fit exercise into a busy schedule.  Well, I mean, I could fit exercise in better if I didn't spend as much time randomly reading articles on the internet.  Twenty minutes isn't that hard to fit in, right?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Productivity Updates</h2>
...Which leads me into wanting to manage my productivity better.  So far, I've had two modes -- one where I'm really productive and do a lot of work and one where I feel hopelessly burnt out and unmotivated.  I have enough academic work, extracurriculars, and personal projects that I have an endless supply of work to do, so I never get the relaxed feeling of having everything done.

My ability to be productive currently involves making a to-do list that ranks tasks by urgency, importance, and completion length, and then doing the steps one-by-one using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> of alternating between 25 minutes doing work and five minutes taking a break.

I've decided that in addition to modifying goals, I can add (or subtract) goals every month as well.  I'll be adding some productivity-maintaining goals.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4x4hr Productivity</h4>
My solution is something I think would be fun to call "4x4hr Productivity".  There are four days a week where I have a lot of free time that I will make blocks of four hours.  During these four hours, I'll commit myself to completing as many tasks as I can, without distraction as much as I'm able, through the Pomodoro Technique.  After those four hours, I'll do whatever I want in the short-term, guilt free.  On the other three days, guilt-free too.

Of course, it's not like I'll be doing nothing those days -- I might choose to do work, or there might be something too urgent to ignore, and I'll have homework due still...

Lastly, time spent exercising is part of the to-do list, so hopefully this goal and the exercise goal will positively interfere and make accomplishing both goals easier.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Read Books Instead of Watching TV</h4>
The second round of productivity updates I want to do is get back into the habit of reading books.  Recently, I've gotten a bit too addicted to watching television at night, even to the point where I've sacrificed sleep and gone to bed at unreasonable hours in order to get in an episode of television.

Instead, I'd like to replace these shows with reading books.  The advantage here is I can tackle <a href="">my lengthy reading list</a> while doing something with a significantly more flexible time period.  If it's almost time for bed, I can just read ten minutes.  Perhaps I might only read a page... As long as I get ahead, it counts.

Furthermore, while long-term good does come out of watching these shows, I expect even more good to come out of reading books.  I've selected my books carefully for the ones that contain knowledge that comes highly recommended from others or from my own searches.

Therefore, I'm committing that on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, I will read from a book and not watch any television.  On all other days, I can either read or watch TV, but place myself under no obligation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hygiene Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #7:</b> Brush my teeth twice a day
<b>Progress as of 4 Feb:</b> 77.8% Success
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> 65.4% Success for 4 Feb - 10 Mar, 73.4% Overall Success

<b>Commentary:</b> I've been kind of surprised at how much of a struggle this has been, given that in theory it should be the easiest habit.  But as I said before, it plagues me when I'm at my weakest -- sleepy, either going to or from bed.  In the morning, I might want to sleep in and have to rush off to class, rather than take the time to brush my teeth.  At night, I've relaxed in bed watching television and don't want to get out.

However, I have a plan that I think will set me back in the right direction.  At night, instead of getting back up to brush my teeth right before bed, instead I will brush my teeth <i>before</i> watching television and getting comfy.  In the morning, I'll set my alarm clock even earlier so I can still "sleep in" while getting up with enough time.  We'll see how these two tricks work.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Driving Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #8:</b> Get my driver's license.
<b>Progress as of 4 Feb:</b> Almost ready to take the test.
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> No change.

<b>Commentary:</b> This has been mostly a scheduling issue -- it's difficult to learn how to drive while I'm at college, so I have to make arrangements to go home.  Luckily, it's spring break and I now have more opportunities to finish up driving lessons.  This week, I'll schedule my test and then come back and take it.  I know I was wrongfully optimistic about this goal in my last update, but I'm still going to be optimistic in this one.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finances Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #9:</b> Do not have expenses I personally have to pay for (rather than my parents paying for them) exceed $2000 (while not causing myself to lose friends, sacrifice other valuable relationships, or otherwise become unhappy).
<b>Progress as of 4 Feb:</b> No concern
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> No concern

<b>Goal #10:</b> Earn at least $6200 (while not sacrificing my long-term future by narrowly focusing on income).
<b>Progress as of 4 Feb:</b> $51/$6200 (0.82%)
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> $205.43/$6200 (3.31%)

<b>Commentary:</b> I've earned some more money, but it's still not nearly at the level I was expecting in order to meet my goal.  In some sense, I think I'm doing ok because I want to focus on doing opportunities that help land me good jobs in the <i>future</i> and worry less about income <i>now</i>.  But I don't know how this goal is going to turn out.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bet Updates</h2>
In my last update, I talked about how I wanted to spruce things up a bit with a bet -- I wagered my friend, Eric "Harry" Brisson, that for the period of 9 Feb – 9 Mar, if I have any less than 95% success (aka any more than 1 failure) in any of my three HabitCal categories (exercise, diet, and hygiene), I owe him $20, but if he fails to update <a href="http://listentobrisson.com/">his blog</a> at least once per week during that interval, he will give me one half of one day’s wage for him.

...This didn't work as well as I hoped.  We both failed our bets and I actually had weakened performance on my goals.  Though, I must say that I was motivated by the bet up until Harry broke his end of the deal and I knew I would be safe (since his wage exceeds $20, presumably).  There were times when I thought I must get up and brush my teeth because if I don't, I'll be out $20.

Thus, we want to get the bet back online.  Therefore, we're going to be doing double-or-nothing.  $40 of mine versus one day's wage for him.  Battle!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Most people's New Years Resolutions fall apart pretty quickly.  And if you judge my goals to have failed when I first messed up, teeth brushing would be over before it started, exercising would have made it to 12 Jan, and the diet lasted until 24 Feb.  However, that's not what this is about -- you can't make lasting habits if you give up at the first failure and then just try again next year.  I'm going to keep going.

As perhaps expected, all my goals started to do worse as the year went on.  But I think I've learned a lot about what it takes to put them into place for a month versus put them into place for a lifetime.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i><b>Note:</b> This essay originally appeared on my previous blog, <a href="http://www.greatplay.net">Greatplay.net</a> and has been moved here.</i>

<b>Follow up to: <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/resolutions-update-march-edition">Resolutions Update - March Edition</a></b>

On 2 Jan, I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions">outlined my New Years Resolutions</a> for this year. I also made sure to publicly commit to these resolutions, since public commitment is a powerful tool to build habits. But it wouldn’t work if I announced it once and then never talked about it again. Additionally, as time goes on, I learn more about how things are going and decide to update my resolutions. Therefore, I’m aiming to provide monthly updates on my progress.  Here's the one for April, following the one <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/resolutions-update-march-edition">from March</a>.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Blogging Update</h2>
<b>Goal #1:</b> Publish 200 essays from 1 Jan 2013 to 31 Dec 2013.
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> 38 essays (19% of goal in 19.1% of allotted time).
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> 52 essays (26% of goal in 24.9% of allotted time).

<b>Commentary:</b> As I noticed last time, I've been slowing down my essay speed.  However, <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/announcing-den-con-2013">Den Con</a> is done and the end of school is near, so I expect there to be no problem in meeting this goal.

<b>Goal #2:</b> Add four games to the <a href="peterhurford.com/stuff.html">arcade</a> by 31 Dec 2013.
<b>Progress as of 4 Feb:</b> Three games are half-made and the last one is started.
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> No change.

<b>Commentary:</b> I ended up not doing anything over Spring Break, so I might not get a start on these projects until after school lets out.  However, I'll see if I can make some time to get one game out before May?  Maybe?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Diet Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #3:</b> Follow the <a href="nosdiet.com">No S Diet</a> -- No Snacks, No Sweets, No Seconds, Except (sometimes) on days that start with "S".
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> 90.9% Success for 4 Feb - 10 Mar; 95.3% Overall Success
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> 100% Success for 11 Mar - 1 Apr; 96.6% Overall Success since 1 Jan (N=58).

<b>Commentary:</b> The diet is going strong.  Apparently, it's not actually that hard to get myself to <i>not</i> do something, so this works really well.  Allowing myself to have Chocolate Milk, Raisin Bran, and to accept snacks given to me deliberately by others has made the diet a lot less dreary too.  I've generally noticed that I've gotten used to eating less as well, so this is less of a struggle.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Exercise Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #4:</b> Exercise five times a week (not Wednesday or Saturday) for at least twenty minutes, either doing circuit exercises or running aiming to be able to run a 5K without needing to stop to walk.
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> 87.5% Success for 4 Feb - 10 Mar, 91.7% Overall Success
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> 38.5% Success for 11 Mar - 1 Apr; 79.2% Overall Success since 1 Jan (N=53).

<b>Commentary:</b> Obviously, this Resolution has started to crash and burn.  Here's the retrospective: after being sick and injured for awhile, I got used to not exercising and my schedule shifted a bit around and I no longer have regular exercising times.  It then became difficult to phase exercise back into the schedule and became an easy thing to skip.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Productivity Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #5:</b> For a period of four non-consecutive hours each Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, work using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> of alternating between 25 minutes doing work and five minutes taking a break.
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> 76.9% (N=13).

<b>Commentary:</b> Despite a lower start, I think this is going well.  It's a good idea that works well, as long as I remember to actually do it and block out the four hours in the day, which is the hard part.  I think the amount of time is a good balance as well, if not maybe a little bit too low.  If I do better in April, I'll aim to up this during the future.  It could be a great way to keep me focused during the summer.

In other news, I've decided that the "read books instead of TV" a few days a week goal wasn't as good as I thought.  TV hasn't been as destructive on my bedtime recently, and I think if bedtimes remain a problem in April, the easier solution would be an hours-of-sleep resolution rather than a TV-resolution.  Watching TV is relaxing, and I want to be able to do it if I can.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hygiene Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #6:</b> Brush my teeth twice a day
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> 65.4% Success for 4 Feb - 10 Mar, 73.4% Overall Success.
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> 66.7% success for 11 Mar - 1 Apr, 73.1% Overall Success since Jan 1 (N=82).

<b>Commentary:</b> Again, this still plagues me when I'm at my weakest -- sleepy, either going to or from bed.  In the morning, I might want to sleep in and have to rush off to class, rather than take the time to brush my teeth.  At night, I've relaxed in bed watching television and don't want to get out.

Last time, I had a plan that instead of getting back up to brush my teeth right before bed, instead I will brush my teeth <i>before</i> watching television and getting comfy and in the morning, I'd set my alarm clock even earlier so I can still "sleep in" while getting up with enough time.  Both these tricks worked for awhile, but then I kind of drifted away from using them.  I need to drift back.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Driving Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #7:</b> Get my driver's license.
<b>Progress as of 4 Feb:</b> Almost ready to take the test.
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> No change.

<b>Commentary:</b> As I said before, this remains mostly a scheduling issue -- it's difficult to learn how to drive while I'm at college, so I have to make arrangements to go home.  I didn't capitalized on Spring Break as much as I hoped, and it turned out I was still wrong to be optimistic.  I think it would be dumb to expect to have it by 1 May too, but definitely by the end of the summer?  Luckily, it doesn't seem like I'll have to drive anywhere regularly during the summer, but my girlfriend and friends would probably still be annoyed they have to drive me around after all this time...

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finances Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #8:</b> Do not have expenses I personally have to pay for (rather than my parents paying for them) exceed $2000 (while not causing myself to lose friends, sacrifice other valuable relationships, or otherwise become unhappy).
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> No concern
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> Slight concern

<b>Commentary:</b> It's difficult to plan for an uncertain future, where I'm not sure how much money I'll make during the summer, what summer expenses will be like, how much plane tickets will cost, and what it will be like to live in an apartment next year instead of a regular dorm.  So I'm slightly concerned I might max out above $2000 and I'll probably have to make a new budget with new circumstances in mind in the future.  For now, however, I can rest assured I have enough savings to back up all my expenses and I have zero chance of going broke.  In the end, it's just an arbitrary monetary goal, but I still want to try and stick to it.

<b>Goal #9:</b> Earn at least $6200 (while not sacrificing my long-term future by narrowly focusing on income).
<b>Progress as of 10 Mar:</b> $205.43/$6200 (3.31%)
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> $407.43/$6200 (6.57%)

<b>Commentary:</b> As I said before, I've earned some more money, but it's still not nearly at the level I was expecting in order to meet my goal.  I still think it's good for me to focus on a route that emphasizes professional development over actual sources of income, but this goal is looking worse for wear unless I can pick up some more summer income from somewhere.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cleaning Updates</h2>
In the spirit of the Resolution tradition, however, I'd like to add a tenth goal back to make up for the one that I've discarded.  My room continues to remain messy even though, internally, I don't feel like a messy person.  I want everything to have it's place and be neat and tidy, I just lack the time and effort to make it so.  Thus, I've decided to make a resolution out of it -- every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, I will return my room to it's clean state.  It might be an impressive undertaking at first, but if I can stop it from getting messy, it will be fine.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bet Updates</h2>
In my last update, I re-wagered my friend, Eric "Harry" Brisson, that for the period of 9 Feb – 9 Mar, if I have any less than 95% success (aka any more than 1 failure) in any of my three HabitCal categories (exercise, diet, and hygiene), I owe him $20, but if he fails to update <a href="http://listentobrisson.com/">his blog</a> at least once per week during that interval, he will give me one half of one day’s wage for him.

It looks like bets don't work.  Both of us payed each other out for our failures and my success rates are lower than ever.  However, despite this, I'd like to insist that the bet did work.  For it was only after I failed the bet at first that I had a "Aww, to hell with it" experience and started going really off the rails in some of my goals.  While the bet was on, I was thinking a lot about how failing it would impact me.

Another problem was that I knew as soon as Eric failed to hold up his bet, I would be earning money, since he bet me more money than I bet him.  This made the bet a lot harder to make imposing in my mind.

Inspired by Maneesh Sethi's <a href="http://zenhabits.net/impossible">"How to Make it Impossible to Fail"</a>, I have a new system that will fix up everything -- wager money <i>per failure</i> rather than in lump sum.  And instead of wagering with Harry, I will wager against myself.  <b>For every failure I have in any given category beyond the first, I will "donate" $5 to <a href="https://secure.gop.com/contribute/?source=header">the US Republican Party</a> and post the receipt on my next update.</b>

Given my general disdain for the Republican Party and it's mismatch with my values, this should be very motivational for me.  I certainly wouldn't have wanted to give them $85 this month!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Most people's New Years Resolutions fall apart pretty quickly.  And if you judge my goals to have failed when I first messed up, teeth brushing would be over before it started, exercising would have made it to 12 Jan, and the diet lasted until 24 Feb.  However, that's not what this is about -- you can't make lasting habits if you give up at the first failure and then just try again next year.  I'm going to keep going.

As perhaps expected, all my goals started to do worse as the year went on.  But I think I've learned a lot about what it takes to put them into place for a month versus put them into place for a lifetime.

Here's the one for May, following the one <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/resolutions-update-april-edition">from April</a>.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Blogging Update</h2>
<b>Goal #1:</b> Publish 200 essays from 1 Jan 2013 to 31 Dec 2013.
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> 52 essays (26% of goal in 24.9% of allotted time)
<b>Progress as of 3 May:</b> 63 essays (31.5% of goal in 33.7% of allotted time)

<b>Commentary:</b> This past month, I had to slow down yet again to account for finals week. Also, I've done the bold move of shifting my blogging over from my old site, <a href="http://www.greatplay.net">Greatplay.net</a>, to this new site you see here, Everyday Utilitarian, which has also slowed me down.  So I'm a bit behind in my goal, but now my school year is done, and I expect I'll be able to get a lot of blogging done over the summer. And I'll have exciting new things to blog about now that I have new direction in my blogging.

<b>Goal #2:</b> Add four games to the <a href="http://www.peterhurford.com/games.html">arcade</a> by 31 Dec 2013.
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> Three games are half-made and the last one is started.
<b>Progress as of 3 May:</b> No change.

<b>Commentary:</b> On the old site, I had a Games Arcade.  I've now moved this over to my personal website and feature my games there.  I still like making games, so I've decided I'm not going to give up on this goal.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Diet Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #3:</b> Follow the <a href="nosdiet.com">No S Diet</a> -- No Snacks, No Sweets, No Seconds, Except (sometimes) on days that start with "S".
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> 100% Success for 11 Mar - 1 Apr
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> 100% Success for 1 Apr - 3 May; 97.4% Overall Success since 1 Jan (N=76).

<b>Commentary:</b> The diet is still going strong and easy to keep up with.  The <a href="nosdiet.com">No S Diet</a> has been simple to keep track of and stick to and amazingly successful, contributing with exercise to me losing more than 35 pounds.  However, I think it's time to experiment with something different.

The No S Diet was successful mainly because it didn't require me to obsessively count calories.  However, I want to try a month at calorie counting and tracking and see how it goes.  Therefore, I've signed up an account at <a href="http://cronometer.com/">Cronometer</a> and will begin tracking my food and exercise.

So I waive all the restrictions of the previous goal.  For this new dieting goal, I pledge to:
<ul>
<li>Ensure I do not consume a net energy of more than 2438kcal each day.  Cronometer says this will lead to a weight loss of 0.5lbs/week at my current weight and height.</li>
<li>Ensure I consume at least 91.5g of protein each day.</li>
<li>Ensure I drink 2.5 liters of water each day.</li>
</ul>

We'll see how this goes for the month.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Exercise Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #4:</b> Exercise five times a week for at least twenty minutes, either doing bodyweight exercises or running, with the goal to be able to run a 5K without needing to stop to walk.
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> 38.5% Success for 11 Mar - 1 Apr
<b>Progress as of 3 May:</b> 90% Success for 1 Apr to 3 May; 82.2% Overall Success since 1 Jan (N=73).

<b>Commentary:</b> Last month, my exercise habit crashed and burned.  This month, despite still being busy for finals, I was able to revive it well and keep it going.  I still haven't been able to reach my previous ability to run 2.7mi without stopping, but I hope to catch up to it soon.

I've also added another program to my exercising routine: <a href="http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/">Stronglifts 5x5</a>.  The website reads like a very strange and overconfident infomercial, but it doesn't sell you anything (at least not immediately) and some of my more fitness-based friends and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness">r/fitness</a> all swear by it.  I'm aiming for my exercise routine to involve five days a week alternating between the Stronglifts weight lifting exercises and trying to run a 5k.  If it's not possible to do Stronglifts (inability to access equipment, for example), I'll go back to my bodyweight exercise routine.

Also, in an attempt to further reduce calories, I'd like to commit to walking 40 minutes a day.  This is about the amount of time I walk around normally in the college environment, but I expect my summer to be far more sedentary and I want to commit to keeping this walking aspect of my life around.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Productivity Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #5:</b> For a period of four non-consecutive hours each Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, work using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> of alternating between 25 minutes doing work and five minutes taking a break.
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> 76.9% (N=13).
<b>Progress as of 3 May:</b> 100% Success for 1 Apr to 3 May; 90.6% overall (N=19)

<b>Commentary:</b> I was able to start implementing this resolution very well once I found a better method of reminding me to start and keep track of my time.  Indeed, it started going so well that when it got to the end of April and I had to complete a lot of tasks for finals, I expanded it to be in effect every day, rather than just four days a week.

I think this resolution suffers a bit from knowing what is and is not "doing work".  Does being in class count?  Does being in a meeting count?  I kind of had to pick and choose.  But there's a better way -- don't maximize time on task, but minimize time <i>off task</i>.  Therefore, I resolve that for at least twelve hours each day on weekdays and nine hours each day on weekends, I will be doing something important, whether it be an item on my to-do list, being in a class or a meeting, or exercising.  Other activities, like socializing and sleeping, will be confined to the other twelve hours in each day.

However, similar to the "S-day" exception from the No S Diet, I reserve the right to waive this productivity requirement whenever special situations (girlfriend visits, trips with friends, vacation, etc.) call for it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hygiene Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #6:</b> Brush my teeth twice a day
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> 66.7% success for 11 Mar - 1 Apr
<b>Progress as of 3 May:</b> 88% success for 1 Apr - 3 May, 77.5% Overall Success since Jan 1 (N=107).

<b>Commentary:</b> This is getting better, but still the hardest habit to maintain.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Driving Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #7:</b> Get my driver's license.
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> Almost ready to take the test.
<b>Progress as of 3 May:</b> No change.

<b>Commentary:</b> As I've said time and time again, this remains mostly a scheduling issue -- it's difficult to learn how to drive while I'm at college.  I hope having more free time over the summer will aim for me to get my license.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finances Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #8:</b> Do not have expenses I personally have to pay for (rather than my parents paying for them) exceed $2000 (while not causing myself to lose friends, sacrifice other valuable relationships, or otherwise become unhappy).
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> Slight concern
<b>Progress as of 3 May:</b> Slight concern

<b>Commentary:</b> As I said before, it's difficult to plan for an uncertain future, where I'm not sure how much money I'll make during the summer, what summer expenses will be like, how much plane tickets will cost, and what it will be like to live in an apartment next year instead of a regular dorm.  So I'm slightly concerned I might max out above $2000 and I'll probably have to make a new budget with new circumstances in mind in the future.  For now, however, I can rest assured I have enough savings to back up all my expenses and I have zero chance of going broke.  In the end, it's just an arbitrary monetary goal, but I still want to try and stick to it.

<b>Goal #9:</b> Earn at least $6200 (while not sacrificing my long-term future by narrowly focusing on income).
<b>Progress as of 1 Apr:</b> $407.43/$6200 (6.57%)
<b>Progress as of 3 May:</b> $479.93/$6200 (7.74%)

<b>Commentary:</b> I'm still not nearly at the level I was expecting in order to meet my goal, and it's unlikely this will change.  I still think it's good for me to focus on a route that emphasizes professional development over actual sources of income, but this goal is looking worse for wear unless I can pick up some more summer income from somewhere.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cleaning Updates</h2>
<b>Goal #10:</b> Clean my room three times a week.
<b>Progress as of 3 May:</b> 75%

<b>Commentary:</b> I started out having picked the wrong days to delcare as the days I would clean my room, and often found myself too busy to start with the initial cleaning.  But once it got cleaned the first time around, it was pretty easy to keep clean.

However, now I'll be ending my junior year of school and therefore my time in a dorm room, so I won't really have a defined area to keep clean.  I'll make sure to try to stick to tidiness, but for now, I'm removing this as a goal of mine.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bet Updates</h2>
Inspired by Maneesh Sethi's <a href="http://zenhabits.net/impossible">"How to Make it Impossible to Fail"</a>, I had pledged to donate $5 to <a href="https://secure.gop.com/contribute/?source=header">the US Republican Party</a> for every time I failed in completing a resolution beyond the first time.  Well, I did fail four times beyond the first -- once on cleaning my room, once on exercising, and twice on brushing my teeth.  Therefore, I "owe" the Republicans $20, and it's time to pay up...

<center><a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gop1.png"><img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gop1-300x237.png" alt="gop1" width="300" height="237" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-17" /></a>

<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gop2.png"><img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gop2-300x170.png" alt="gop2" width="300" height="170" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18" /></a></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

This month, my total amount of failures went from 21 down to 7.  I'm going to attribute most of this to the power of this per failure betting mechanism.  There were definitely times where I really felt like not doing one of my habits, but then remembered that I would have to pay up if I failed.  Then there were times where I thought no one would find out if I failed, but then remembered that I pre-commited to this betting plan on my website.  I considered lying, but then I realized that would derail everything I wanted to accomplish.  So I decided to go on with the habit, despite the discomfort.

Thus, given this success, I'm going to keep this wager.  Hopefully I won't have to give any more hard earned money to the Republican Party any more.  It's already motivating me to succeed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just a little over a year ago, I wrote <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-reading">"What is Peter Reading?"</a> to keep track of... well... what I was reading.  I decided that I want to do the same thing, except for something a bit more fun and light-hearted -- the television shows I'm watching.  Thus, "What is Peter Watching?"

The way I currently watch TV is to watch all the episodes of a season in the series (usually with Netflix), ranging from one per day to one per week (sometimes in fifteen minute installments).  Only when I'm finished with a season of the show do I move on to the next one.

If you have any suggestions for television shows to watch, feel free to recommend some in the comments section!

				<title>How is Peter Exercising? 2013</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've made a variety of New Years Resolutions this year to commit to exercise.  I decided that I want a more detailed log to keep track of my progress on these plans so I know where to resume for future exercises and look back on my progress.  I then decided, in the spirit of my <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-reading">reading list</a> and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-watching">TV list</a>, why not make this public too?

Currently, I'm working on (1) <a href="http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/">Stronglifts 5x5 Beginner Strength Training Program</a> and (2) running once a week.

In the past, I've committed to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0938045768">Convict Conditioning</a> with the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1gbfx2/training_for_34_hours_a_day_6_days_a_week_as_ido/">Reddit modifications</a>, the Mount Holyoke’s Athletic Training <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_D_IjuAUl8">"No Excuses Workout"</a> [YouTube], a vaguer kind of <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/?smid=fb-nytimes&WT.z_sma=HL_TS7_20130510">high intensity interval circuit training</a>, the <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml">Couch to 5K</a> running plan, the <a href="http://www.hundredpushups.com">Hundred Pushups plan</a>, and the <a href="http://www.twohundredsitups.com">Two Hundred Sit-ups plan</a>, but for various reasons, I'm not doing those anymore.

Nothing in this list is meant to be that awe inspiring.  I recognize myself as below average at fitness, but I'm getting much better.<!--more-->

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I consider myself a utilitarian.  I'm not a perfect one, and I don't think people have to be.  However, before I focus on that, I'd like to focus on what "utilitarianism" means.  When I say I'm a utilitarian, I'm saying that I have set out to make the world a better place, to the best of my ability.  And by better place, I'm talking about a world where there everyone is better off than they were earlier.

Utilitarianism is a moral theory that says that one should aim to "maximize utility" whenever possible.  What counts as "utility" is still more or less open for debate, but it can be thought of as "happiness", "flourishing", "well-being", "welfare", "pleasure", or "life satisfaction".  These are all tricky concepts and I'll tend to use them interchangably, but this isn't to side-step an important debate about their differences and distinctions.  Luckily for us, however, except in strange scenarios, everyone agrees on what makes things better for the most part.  If Joan is suffering from malaria, it would be better to cure her disease.  If Roger is living on $1 a day, it would be better to lift him out of poverty.  It doesn't matter whether we're talking about happiness, flourishing, or pleasure... we should do these things.

When I think of utilitarianism, I think of three things: equality for all, only welfare matters, and we must act on our priorities.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Equality for All</h2>
Utilitarianism isn't just about people with white Anglo-Saxon sounding names.  Instead, utilitarians care about everyone that is capable of suffering and capable of having their life improved.  One wouldn't care about a rock or a fern, because rocks and ferns don't have feelings.  But one would care about an african child, a United States senator, a Chinese schoolteacher, or a pig in a farm, because all these people have feelings.

Perhaps more radically, utilitarians aim, in so far as is possible, to treat the interests of all of these beings <i>equally</i>.  This isn't to say that the President of the United States is no more important than the pig in the farm.  It is to say, however, that the interests of the pig in the farm matters, and there might be some circumstances where we'd be in a better position to improve the life of a pig than the life of the President.  Certainly, if the President and the pig were both trapped in a burning building and I could only save one, I'd save the President.  But if the President had a hangnail and the pig was about to be lit on fire, I'd help the pig first.

Anything other than equality would be some sort of arbitrary, discriminatory bias — like racism in ignoring the preferences of other races, sexism in ignoring the preferences of other genders, speciesism in ignoring the preferences of other species, etc. If there’s no reason to favor someone more, the default position seems to be equality, and that’s where utilitarianism starts.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Only Welfare Matters</h2>
...And that's also where utilitarianism ends.  When it comes to evaluating a situation, how it impacts welfare is all that matters.  To a utilitarian, lying isn't bad simply because it's <i>lying</i>, but because deception frequently erodes trust in society and often makes people worse off.  There may be cases, however, where lying makes people better off, and we experience this all the time with so-called "white lies".

There's nothing magical about bad things that make them bad.  Instead, bad things are bad for a specific <i>reason</i>: they create consequences that result in lives being worse.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>We Must Act on Our Priorities</h2>
Thirdly, utilitarianism is about prioritization. If you can spend an hour offering Alice homework help or spend an hour saving Bob from drowning, then, all else being equal, utilitarianism asks you to spend your hour saving Bob from drowning. This is because while Alice would definitely receive a benefit from getting helped with her homework, Bob would receive a dramatically larger benefit for the same amount of time, and that would maximize welfare more with the same amount of resources, which utilitarianism considers better (all things being equal). This makes utilitarianism very similar to any other sort of cost-benefit analysis, except costs and benefits are measured in the happiness of all those being affected.

It really would be nice to solve all the problems of the world.  But we can't -- we lack the time and the resources.  Therefore, we must focus on the actions that are best able to help the most people, and do those things, with regret that we don't have the ability to do more.  This isn't ruthless or cold-hearted, but the only way we can save the most people.  People's lives literally depend on prioritization, because more people would die if we ended up doing a less efficient method.  Prioritization matters.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Utilitarianism is a fairly complex philosophy with lots of misconceptions.  I intend to clear up those misconceptions as this blog goes on and establish utilitarianism as a philosophy and lifestyle that can be commonsense and lived out in everyday life.  But utilitarianism doesn't need to be complex.  It's actually fairly simple.  If you think that everyone should be treated equally and recognize that we can't save everyone at once and must prioritize, then you'd sympathize with utilitarianism.  There certainly are other motivations to be a utilitarian, and I'll talk about them eventually.  But a concern for equality is my motivation.

Sometimes, I think utilitarianism gets a bit too "ivory tower" in it's discussion and debate, and not enough action actually takes place.  Sure, we must debate the finer points of what to do and where to allocate our resources, because that will really matter.  But we also have the chance to make a big differences in the lives of humans and animals.  That's a lot simpler of a take away and we need to do that too.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I found this example from Scanlon, what do you think?:

 Suppose that Jones has suffered an accident in the transmitter room of a television station. Electrical equipment has fallen on his arm, and we cannot rescue him without turning off the transmitter for 15 minutes. A World Cup match is in progress, watched by many people, and it will not be over for an hour. Jones’s injury will not get any worse if we wait, but his hand has been mashed and he is receiving extremely painful electrical shocks. Should we rescue him now or wait until the match is over? Does the right thing to do depend on how many people are watching – whether it is one million or five million or a hundred million?]]></wp:comment_content>

You're a utilitarian who (somehow) denies ultimate moral truths. It's disconcerting that you haven't even tried to square this circle. (See "Utilitarianism twice fails" — http://tinyurl.com/bfcm89e )

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[joseph, interesting example. It has some real-world analogies; there was a severe accident in the German show "Wetten Dass?" a while back. A candidate who jumped over cars in a bet fell and became a paraplegic. Following that, there was a discussion how much risk an entertainment show can accept.

I think people would react very differently to taking (consensual) risks and inflicting certain damage. In your example, the social fallout from harming the guy on purpose would be enough to make it both bad business and a bad 'utilitarian' choice (making millions feel bad about their entertainment).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[@Hedonic Treader,
I assumed he was conscious, but your question definitely wasn't stupid. Animals under anaesthesia do exhibit signs of pain, for instance the heart rate typically increases when you pull on the ovarian ligament during a bitch spay, and best practice, where I was trained, was to give a short acting opioid analgesic, such as fentanyl, on these occassions. So I'd hazard that unconscious beings still experience pain on some level, though I'd also guess there's unlikely to be any memory of it. (This differs from human anaesthesia, as they often use muscle relaxants, so sometimes the subject is essentially paralysed, but not under anaesthesia). p.s. Yes "anaesthesia" has 3 a's.]]></wp:comment_content>

His consent should be required (maybe he wants to support his children). If all parties consent to an exchange while all the exit options are maintained (the Christian and the Romans could walk away from the interaction), then you have evidence that the net benefit outweighs the net harm.

Same for the cheap goods. Actual slavery is a problem, cheap voluntary labor is not. Genuine consensualism is a good filter for mutual beneficience.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm sorry to pose such a ethical delema but I feel like you see utiliarianism in a very positive light and in consequence, you problably try to bring a lot of good to the world. I'm just trying to play devil's advocate in asking your opinion on a challenging scenerio. What do you feel in the case child labor in china that help produce the cheap goods for people all across more developed countries? The amount of euphoria and joy these goods bring may in fact outway the pain and suffering experienced by the children and young adults that produce them. In that case, do you feel like such actions are justified? How about in ancient times when the Romans would throw the Christrians to the lions, the torture experienced by one Christian was surely outweighed by the entertainment and pleasure experienced by several thousand Romans. Is that justified? What limits as a utilitarian do you put on yourself if any? I'm sure you have the best intentions however I am curious on your views.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi.

My name is Peter Hurford.  I attend <a href="http://www.denison.edu/">Denison University</a> as an undergraduate senior.  That's a small liberal arts college a little bit outside Columbus, Ohio.  There I study political science and psychology, and I have a concentration in organizational studies.  If you want to know more about me as a pre-professional, I have a personal website located at <a href="http://www.peterhurford.com">PeterHurford.com</a>.

I used to write a blog called <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/">Greatplay.net</a> for many years, starting blogging in 2009.  In the fall of 2010, I read Richard Carrier's <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1420802933">Sense and Goodness Without God</a></b> and Nicholas Everitt's <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0415301068">The Nonexistence of God</a></b>.  I can't say that I believed in God prior to reading these books, but I definitely didn't believe in God after reading these books, and I promptly shifted my blog to a large discussion of why that was the case.  Philosophy of religion mattered a lot to me then, and I wrote about it frequently.  Around this time, I got involved with the community website <a href="http://www.lesswrong.com">Less Wrong</a>.

In the fall of 2011, things changed again.  I read Peter Singer's <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400067103">The Life You Can Save</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061711306">Animal Liberation</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521707684">Practical Ethics</a></b>, and <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0879759666">How Are We to Live</a></b>.  For the second time in my life, reading books changed everything.  I continued to see some harm in religion, but this was dwarfed dramatically by the harms that come from factory farming and income inequality.  I almost immediately resolved to stop eating meat and donate some of my income to <a href="http://www.givewell.org">effective non-profits in the third world</a>.

Over the summer of 2012, I got involved in <a href="http://www.felicifia.org">Felicifia</a>, a utilitarian forum, and spoke to many of the people there.  I joined <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> a little later, and pledged to donate 10% of my income.  I kept reading books and learning more about organizations not just working to make the world a better place, but <i>best</i> make the world the <i>best</i> place -- a movement called <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/what-effective-altruism">effective altruism</a>.

Now, in the summer of 2013, I decided that it's time to re-invent my blog and dedicate it to exploring these big issues in life.  Therefore, you get <b>Everyday Utilitarian</b>, or my blog dedicated to my quest to become just that... an everyday utilitarian, or someone who seeks to put utilitarianism into their everyday life.  This blog will definitely focus on the abstract debates you frequently see on philosophy blogs.  But it will be a bit more than that.  There will be self-improvement and lifestyle building as I craft my everyday utilitarianism.  And there will be some discussion of science as it can help build utilitarian communities and answer deep questions about ethics.  And there will be political commentary from my utilitarian perspective.

There are other self-improvement sites out there.  But I don't have all the answers, and I'm not out to give you advice.  Instead, this blog is a personal blog about a journey, where I work on my life and give you updates on how things are going.  And it's about a particular kind of life -- one that seeks to put utilitarianism into practice and make the world a better place.  Hopefully you'll take something out of it and enjoy it.

Let me know.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One hundred twenty-six days ago, I was overweight.  I was 6'1" and 220lbs. I needed to do something, so I turned to was exercise.  I started out trying to run.  I could barely run half a mile before I got winded and had to stop.  I couldn't keep going.  Now, 126 days later, I have run my first 5k.  I didn't do an official 5k or anything.  I just ran the 5k distance (3.1 miles) -- run away from my house, go 1.55 miles down the street, turn around, and run 1.55 miles back.

I had never run a 5k before.  I had once been very close.  I got all the way to 2.7 miles.  But then I got injured for a week, sick for another week, and didn't run for almost all of March.  I tried running again after that, but I got tired after running just a mile, and I stopped.  Eventually, after a bit more practice I worked my way back to being able to run 1.5 miles, but it still wasn't going well.  I was a long way away from being able to break the 5k barrier.<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Today, I wanted to run again.  I set out, thinking I could at least beat my previous 1.5 mile plateau.  This was the day I could run 1.6 miles.  It ended up being the day I ran my first 5k.  I not only broke through my plateau, but doubled the distance, broke through, and did what I never thought was possible.

I'm amazed at how much of the effort was mental.  The road I was on was very hilly, and I was weighed down by the knowledge that I hadn't been running so well recently.  Eventually, I saw one of the hills in the distance, and it looked steep.  I knew that I would never be able to run up them.  But I told myself that this was the time I had to do it, and I was determined to just not stop.  So I ended up running up the hill.  It turned out to not be steep at all.  The steepness that I had perceived earlier was just an optical illusion produced by the distance.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Eventually, the next hill came up.  It looked steep.  But I ran up it all the same, barely even noticing how steep it was once I actually came to it.  I grew amazed by how much of this was in my head; how much I was dramatizing it and making it worse with my negative thoughts.  Eventually, running a bit further, I got a pain in my chest.  I thought I should stop, just in case it was a problem.  This time, however, I decided to keep going, and barely two minutes later, the chest pain went away without any issue.

A bit longer in, my shoulder started hurting.  I wanted to stop.  I didn't.  Two minutes later, the shoulder pain was gone.

Later in, I started having a bit of trouble breathing.  I wanted to stop.  I didn't.  Eventually, I stabilized my breath, and kept on running just fine.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I think a lot of challenges in my life only look like challenges from the beginning, and I dramatized them with negative thoughts.  Now, I don't think that getting rid of negative thoughts is the secret of all of success.  I don't think that we shouldn't pay attention to challenges.  And I definitely don't think it's a good idea to keep running if you're experiencing pain and it isn't going away.

But many times in my life, I've noticed that I, as the idiom goes, "make a mountain out of a molehill".  But when I get to the hill and think it's too much of a mountain to surpass, I'm amazed at how easy it ends up being if I just pay no attention and keep on going.  Many of the mountains I encounter aren't mountains at all.  And I'm more successful when I remember that, and just keep on running.

It will be easier than I thought, because those are not mountains.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Don&#039;t Take (My) Advice Too Seriously</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/dont-take-my-advice-too-seriously/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This website is about things that have worked <i>for me</i>.  The "for me" part is key.  This website isn't about giving you advice, as much as I want other people to share in my lifestyle choices.  Why?  Well, first, I'm not nearly experienced enough to offer you advice.  But second, <b>the advice probably won't work.</b>

I have a theory, which <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/9v/beware_of_otheroptimizing/">Eliezer Yudkowsky also discovered</a>, that many people will hunt through the web looking for tips on something: how to run, how to make a to-do list, etc., that optimize some part of their life.  They'll consider, say, five or six different approaches, and then they'll finally find the one <i>that works</i>.  And this is a magical moment that must be shared with everyone, because your dedication has unveiled the one method <i>that works</i>, and you can save everyone the time of trying the five other approaches that <i>don't work</i>.

...Except you missed a step. You forgot to take into account that while people are rather similar, there's enough individual differences in what people prefer, what makes people comfortable, how people think about things, etc., that what works for you <i>might not work for other people</i>.  Indeed, all six of the approaches you consider probably have each worked for <i>someone</i> at one point or another, <i>or they wouldn't have been written about in the first place</i>.  No one, I hope, writes about failed self-improvement methods, unless... well... it's about how those methods have failed.<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I really sympathize with the idea of finding <i>the best</i> self-improvement methods.  But I'm pretty skeptical that they exist.  Back when <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com">Overcoming Bias</a> was a group blog, Katja Grace wrote about how self-experimentation, or trying different things to find the best habits and behaviors, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/03/personal-experimentation-summary.html">appears to be beneficial even when it shouldn't be</a>, because all of the best habits should have been discovered a long time ago.

Grace considers five possibilities: (a) she is a strange individual, (b) there's an unending amount of things to try and optimize, (c) findings are not aggregated or shared well, (d) people are too different for one-size-fits-all advice, and (e) the perceived benefits are illusory.  At the end, she decides to place the bulk of the blame on poor data aggregation and sharing, which probably is true.  But I'd place more blame on context being different and people being different.

Over at <a href="http://www.lesswrong.com">Less Wrong</a>, Luke Meulhauser <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3nn/scientific_selfhelp_the_state_of_our_knowledge/">summarized the state of self-help literature</a>.  I can summarize his summary in five words, assuming you count a hyphenated word as two words: <b>Self-help is a mess.</b>  Indeed, fitness and diet advice are also messes, and you'd think those would be more scientific.  The internet... heck even the peer-reviewed studies themselves... are a minefield of contradictory and mutually exclusive information.  Though there is some information that falls through the gaps and seems good... for <i>most people</i>.  Good luck if you're atypical.

And this seems true anecdotally too.  Consider the question: when should I exercise?  I personally can't exercise right before I go to bed, or I'm too hyper to fall asleep.  A friend of mine considers exercise right before bed to be relaxing, however, and for him, it's the easiest time to do it.  Other people exercise in the middle of the day, or right after getting up, and insist it's the best time they've found.  All I've learned from this advice is the best time to exercise is whenever you'll stick with it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
I'm going to keep trucking onward in this blog and, among other things, tell you what has worked for me.  This may seem like advice.  And in some ways, it is.  Perhaps I'm helping to address the problem that findings aren't aggregated or shared well.  But in reality, I'd like you to not take my advice -- or any advice -- too seriously.

Advice is important.  And you shouldn't ignore those who have experience and who have done the things you seek to do.  You should stand on the shoulders of giants.  But at the same time, remember that there is no one-size-fits all advice.  Maybe some day they'll find a way to work out your personality and way of thinking about things and can scientifically tailor advice to you.  But that day hasn't come yet.

Until then, you'll have to try things for yourself and actually <i>see what works for you</i>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Back on <a href="http://www.greatplay.net">the old blog</a>, I ran something I called <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/category/link-roundup">the Weekly Link Roundup</a>.  I started about two years ago, and over the time, created 72 of them.  I really valued this opportunity to share links not just to spread some of the great writing and videos around, but also catalog them for my personal reference.  Here, I'm going to do the same, except it will be on Sundays.  Hence, Sunday Links.

Remember that I don’t necessarily agree with everything stated in every article. Feel free to comment or ask.

In <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/344508.html">"Further Adventures in Being Biased and Bad with Money"</a>, Scott Alexander explains a bias he noticed where he'd rather pay $200 for a flight with free internet and food than $150 for a flight where you have to pay $10 each for internet and food.  It's a bias that sounds really weird when I say it, but that I totally fall for in real life and would be worth exploring further.  I think it's a matter of how people construct "mental buckets" for spending, and $200 is totally reasonable for your "flight" bucket the same way $150 is, but $10 is not reasonable for your "food" bucket.  Same reason why people will travel several miles to save $10 on gasoline, but not travel several miles to save $10 on a car.

Speaking of which, here are <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/09/9-ways-marketing-weasels-will-try-to-manipulate-you.html">"Nine Ways Marketing Weasels Will Try to Manipulate You"</a>, based on biases like that.  Pricing bias is the most scary.  But watch out for the mentions that "rationality can be cold, unemotional, and bad" (<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/90n/summary_of_the_straw_vulcan/">straw vulcanism</a>) at the bottom of the essay.<!--more-->

In other news, is IQ heritable?  <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/347907.html">Another Scott Alexander piece</a> makes me think the answer is that I have no friggin' clue, even though I learned about the heritability of IQ from credible psychologists with credible PhDs.

Paul Krugman re-reminds us <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/opinion/krugman-kick-that-can.html">that now is still a really bad time to cut government spending</a>.

Patrick Stokes explains <a href="http://theconversation.com/no-youre-not-entitled-to-your-opinion-9978">how it is dangerous for people to be "entitled to their opinion"</a>.

This is old news, but Peter Singer and Agata Sagan <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/jan/18/death-aaron-swartz/">argue for new rights to JSTOR articles and better management of depression</a> in the wake of Aaron Swartz's death.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As Peter Singer writes in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400067103"><b>The Life You Can Save</b></a>: "[t]he world would be a much simpler place if one could bring about social change merely by making a logically consistent moral argument".  Many people one encounters might agree that a social change movement is noble yet not want to do anything to promote it, or want to give more money to a charity yet refrain from doing so.  Additional moralizing doesn't seem to do the trick.  ...So what does?

Motivating people to altruism is relevant for the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/6py/optimal_philanthropy_for_human_beings/">optimal philanthropy movement</a>.  For a start on the answer, like many things, I turn to psychology.  Specifically, the psychology Peter Singer catalogues in his book.<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Single, Identifiable Victim</h2>
One of the most well-known motivations behind helping others is a personal connection, which triggers empathy.  When psychologists researching generosity paid participants to join a psychological experiment and then later gave these participants the opportunity to donate to a global poverty fighting organization <a href="http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6115947/k.8D6E/Official_Site.htm">Save the Children</a>, two different kinds of information were given.

One random group of participants were told "Food shortages in Malawi are affecting more than three million children" and some additional information about how the need for donations was very strong, and these donations could help stop the food shortages.

Another random group of participants were instead shown the photo of Rokia, a seven-year-old Malawian girl who is desperately poor.  The participants were told that "her life will be changed for the better by your gift".

Furthermore, a third random group of participants were shown the photo of Rokia, told about who she is and that "her life will be changed for the better", but ALSO told about the general information about the famine and told the same "food shortages [...] are affecting more than three million" -- a combination of both the previous groups.

Lastly, a fourth random group was shown the photo of Rokia, informed about her the same as the other groups, and then given information about another child, identified by name, and told that their donation would also affect this child too for the better.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>It's All About the Person</h4>
Interestingly, the group who was told ONLY about Rokia gave the most money.  The group who was told about both children reported feeling less overal emotion than those who only saw Rokia, and gave less money.  The group who was told about both Rokia and the general famine information gave even less than that, followed by the group that only got the general famine information.<sup>1,2</sup>  It turns out that information about a single person was the most salient for creating an empathetic response to trigger a willingness to donate.<sup>1,2</sup>

This continues through additional studies.  In another generosity experiment, one group of people was told that a single child needed a lifesaving medical treatment that costs $300K, and was given the opportunity to contribute towards this fund.  A second random group of people was told that eight children needed a lifesaving treatment, and all of them would die unless $300K could be provided, and was given an opportunity to contribute.  More people opted to donate toward the single child.<sup>3,4</sup>  

This is the basis for why we're so willing to chase after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Copiap%C3%B3_mining_accident">lost miners</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_McClure">Baby Jessica</a> no matter the monetary cost, but turn a blind eye to the mass unknown starving in the developing world.  Indeed, the person doesn't even need to be particularly identified, though it does help.  In another experiment, people asked by researchers to make a donation to Habitat for Humanity were more likely to do so if they were told that the family "has been selected" rather than that they "will be selected" -- even though all other parts of the pitch were the same, and the participants got no information about who the families actually were.<sup>5</sup>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Deliberative and The Affective</h4>
Why is this the case?  Researcher Paul Slovic thinks that humans have two different processes for deciding what to do.  The first is an <b>affective system</b> that responds to emotion, rapidly processing images and stories and generating an intuitive feeling that leads to immediate action.  The second is a <b>deliberative system</b> that draws on reasoning, and operates on words, numbers, and abstractions, which is much slower to generate action.<sup>6</sup>

This time, the Rokia experiment was done again, except yet another twist was added -- there were two groups, one told only about Rokia exactly as before, and one told only the generic famine information exactly as before.  Within each group, half the group took a survey designed to arouse their emotions by asking them things like "When you hear the word 'baby' how do you feel?"  The other half of both groups was given emotionally neutral questions, like math puzzles.

This time, the Rokia group gave far more, but those in the group who randomly had their emotions aroused gave even more than those who heard about Rokia but had finished math problems.  On the other side, those who heard the generic famine information showed no increase in donation regardless of how heightened their emotions were.<sup>1</sup>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Futility and Making a Difference</h2>
Imagine you're told that there are 3000 refugees at risk in a camp in Rwanda, and you could donate towards aid that would save 1500 of them.  Would you do it?  And how much would you donate?

Now this time imagine that you can still save 1500 refugees with the same amount of money, but the camp has 10000 refugees.  In an experiment where these two scenarios were presented not as a thought experiment but as realities to two separate random groups, the group that heard of only 3000 refugees were more likely to donate, and donated larger amounts.<sup>7,8</sup>

Enter another quirk of our giving psychology, right or wrong: <b>futility thinking</b>.  We think that if we're not making a sizable difference, it's not worth making the difference at all -- it will only be a drop in the ocean and the problem will keep raging on.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Am I Responsible?</h2>
People are also far less likely to help if they're with other people.  In this experiment, students were invited to participate in a market research survey.  However, when the researcher gave the students their questionnaire to fill out, she went into a back room separated from the office only by a curtain.  A few minutes later, noises strongly suggested that she had got on a chair to get something from a high shelf, and then fell off it, screaming that she couldn't feel or move her foot.

With only one student taking the survey, 70% of them stopped what they were doing and offered assistance.  However, when there were two students taking the survey, this number dropped down dramatically.  Most noticeably, when the group was two students -- but one of the students was a stooge who was in on it and would always not respond, the response rate of the non-stooge participant was only 7%.<sup>9</sup>

This one is known as <b>diffusion of responsibility</b>, better known as the <b>bystander effect</b> -- we help more often when we think it is our responsibility to do so, and -- again for right or for wrong -- we naturally look to others to see if they're helping before doing so ourselves.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What's Fair In Help?</h2>
It's clear that people value fairness, even to their own detriment.  In a game called "the Ultimatum Game", one participant is given a sum of money by the researcher, say $10, and told they can split this money with an anonymous second player in any proportion they choose -- give them $10, give them $7, give them $5, give them nothing, everything is fair game.  The catch is, however, the second player, after hearing of the split anonymously, gets to vote to accept it or reject it.  Should the split be accepted, both players walk away with the agreed amount.  But should the split be rejected, both players walk away with nothing.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A Fair Split</h4>
The economist, expecting ideally rational and perfectly self-interested players, predicts that the second player would accept any split that gets them money, since anything is better than nothing.  And the first player, understanding this, would naturally offer $1 and keep $9 for himself.  At no point are identities revealed, so reputation and retribution are no issue.

But the results turn out to be quite different -- the vast majority offer an equal split.  Yet, when an offer comes around that offers $2 or less, it is almost always rejected, even though $2 is better than nothing.<sup>10</sup>  And this effect persists even when played for thousands of dollars and persists across nearly all cultures.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Splitting and Anchoring in Charity</h4>
This sense of fairness persists into helping as well -- people generally have a strong tendency not to want to help more than the other people around them, and if they find themselves the only ones helping on a frequent basis, they start to feel a "sucker".  On the flipside, if others are doing more, they will follow suit.<sup>11,12,13</sup>

Those told the average donation to a charity nearly always tend to give that amount, even if the average told to them is a lie, having secretly been increased or decreased.  And it can be replicated even without lying -- those told about an above average gift were far more likely to donate more, even attempting to match that gift.<sup>14,15</sup>  Overall, we tend to match the behavior of our reference class -- those people we identify with -- and this includes how much we help.  We donate more when we believe others are donating more, and donate less when we believe others are doing so.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Challenging the Self-Interest Norm</h2>
But there's a way to break this cycle of futility, responsibility, and fairness -- challenge the norm by openly communicating about helping others.  While many religious and secular values insist that the best giving is anonymous giving, this turns out to not always be the case.  While there may be other reasons to give anonymously, don't forget the benefits of giving openly -- being open about helping inspires others to help, and can help challenge the norms of the culture.

Indeed, many organizations now exist to help challenge the norms of donations and try to create a culture where they give more.  <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">GivingWhatWeCan</a> is a community of 230 people (including me!) who have all pledged to donate at least 10% of their income to organizations working on ending extreme poverty, and submit statements proving so.  <a href="http://boldergiving.org/stories.php">BolderGiving</a> has a bunch of inspiring stories of over 100 people who all give at least 20% of their income, with a dozen giving over 90%!  And these aren't all rich people, some of them are even ordinary students.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Who's Willing to Be Altruistic?</h4>
While people are not saints, experiments have shown that people tend to grossly overestimate how self-interested other people are -- for one example, people estimated that males would overwhelmingly favor a piece of legislation to "slash research funding to a disease that affects only women", even while -- being male -- they themselves do not support such legislation.<sup>16</sup>

This also manifests itself in an expectation that people be "self-interested" in their philanthropic cause -- suggesting much stronger support for volunteers in Students Against Drunk Driving who themselves knew people killed in drunk driving accidents versus those people who had no such personal experiences but just thought it to be "a very important cause".<sup>17</sup>

Alex de Tocqueville, echoing the early economists who expected $9/$1 splits in the Ultimatum Game, wrote in 1835 that "Americans enjoy explaining almost every act of their lives on the principle of self-interest".<sup>18</sup>  But this isn't always the case, and in challenging the norm, people make it more acceptable to be altruistic.  It's not just "goody two-shoes", and it's praiseworthy to be "too charitable".
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Bit of a Nudge</h2>
A somewhat pressing problem in getting people to help was in organ donation -- surely no one was inconvenienced by having their organs donated after they had died.  Yet, why would people not sign up?  And how could we get more people to sign up?

In Germany, only 12% of the population are registered organ donors.  In nearby Austria, that number is 99.98%.  Are people in Austria just less worried about what will happen to them after they die, or just that more altruistic?  It turns out the answer is far more simple -- in Germany you must put yourself on the register to become a potential donor (opt-in), whereas in Austria you are a potential donor unless you object (opt-out).  While people may be, for right or for wrong, worried about the fate of their body after it is dead, they appear less likely to express these reservations in opt-out systems.<sup>19</sup>

While Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein argue in their book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300122233"><b>Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wellness, and Happiness</b></a> that we sometimes suck at making decisions in our own interest and all could do better with more favorable "defaults", such defaults are also pressing in helping people.

While opt-out organ donation is a huge deal, there's another similar idea -- <b>opt-out philanthropy</b>.  Back before 2008 when the investment bank Bear Stearns still existed, listed their guiding principle as philanthropy as fostering good citizenship and well-rounded individuals.  To this effect, <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E4DB1530F931A25752C1A9619C8B63&pagewanted=all">they required the top 1000 most highest paid employees to donate 4% of their salary and bonuses to non-profits</a>, and prove it with their tax returns.  This resulted in more than $45 million in donations during 2006.  Many employees described the requirement as "getting themselves to do what they wanted to do anyway".
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
So, according to this bit of psychology, what could we do to get other people to help more, besides moralize?  Well, we have five key take-aways:

(1) present these people with a single and highly identifiable victim that they can help,
(2) nudge them with a default of opt-out philanthropy,
(3) be more open about our willingness to be altruistic and encourage other people to help,
(4) make sure people understand the average level of helping around them, and
(5) instill a responsibility to help and an understanding that doing so is not futile.  

Hopefully, with these tips and more, helping people more can be come just one of those things we do.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've noticed that quite a few people are interested in fostering communities -- both creating communities and improving them to make them work together.  But how do we go about actually doing this?  What's there to community that we can foster and build upon?  What makes a community thrive, and how do we take advantage of this to make and/or improve communities?

To answer these questions, I turned to two books:

The first is <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385525761">The Penguin and The Leviathan: How Cooperation Triumphs Over Self-Interest</a></b> by Yochai Benkler.  Benkler, in writing about cooperative systems (Penguins, named after the Linux Penguin) and hierarchical systems (Leviathans, named after Thomas Hobbes's The Leviathan), studies the psychology, economics, and political science of cooperation and helps explain what makes communities stick.

The second is <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1118143302">Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive</a></b> by Bruce Schneier.  Schneier studies trust and cooperation from a dizzying variety of sciences (psychology, biology, economics, anthropology, computer science, and political science).  Schneier's ultimate game is figuring out what is preventing society from falling apart, and that can be applied to building communities.

Let's see what they got.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Communities Need Cooperation</h2>
Schneier and Benkler both paint a view of human nature that is different than what is commonly thought, but what has emerged from the sciences: People are both self-interested and other-interested, different people will have different balances of each, and within each person these two goals can often conflict.  Additionally, the "other-interested" aspect can be multiple and occasionally conflicting allegiances, such as to one's family, to one's neighborhood, to one's country, to one's venture philanthropy club, etc.

What's unique to all communities is that they involve people who have set aside some of their immediate self-interest to work together.  For instance, when we work together in a group, I definitely don't beat you over the head and steal your lunch money, and I don't usually attempt to free ride and get you to do the group work for me, but we mutually work to solve communal problems and share in the benefits of community.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Public Goods and Free Riders</h4>
An example of how psychology has sought to simplify and simulate a community is through what's called <b>"The Public Goods Game"</b>.  In this game, a group of about ten participants are each sat down, and given $10 each to start with.  The game is then played for several rounds, and in each round all participants get to put a certain secret amount of their money into a collective pot.  The experimenters then look at the pot, double the amount of money inside it, and redistribute the result evenly to all the players.  For added bonus, the experimenters inform all participants that they get to walk away with their winnings after the game is over.

If everyone went perfectly with the community, each player would see their money double each round.  But the wrinkle is that if people don't contribute at all to the pot, then they stand to gain even more money from the results of everyone else's contributions.  This is called <b>the free rider problem</b>: there is a tension between wanting to contribute to the pot for the good of yourself and the good of the group as a whole and refraining from contributing so that you benefit even more.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Free Rider Problem and The Collective Action Problem</h4>
But the tension can result in further disaster, for imagine everyone decides to be a free rider and defect from the group -- now, no money goes in the pot at all, and everyone ends with the $10 they start with.  This gets worse when we imagine some other real-life scenarios -- for instance, that of fishermen in a lake.

The fishermen can either choose to fish normally or overfish.  If all the fishermen overfish, they stand to deplete the lake and all fishermen lose their jobs.  However, if just a few fishermen overfish, they get the benefit of added fish to sell, and the lake can handle the slight increase in load.  So this tension is to be the fisherman that wins most by personally overfishing, while not collectively depleting the entire lake.  Such problems are called <b>collective action problems</b> -- people do well individually by defecting but do worse collectively if everyone defects.  The result of a collective action problem ending in disaster is called <b>the tragedy of the commons</b>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Community Solution</h4>
So what's the solution to these problems?  Benkler proposes two models for dealing with them -- employing the Leviathan and placing lots of regulations on overfishing and enforcing them with strict punishments, or employing the Penguin and creating a community that deals with these problems collectively and in a self-policing way.

It turns out that certain problems are best dealt with differing combinations of Leviathan and Penguin models, but most problems need lots of community just because it can be difficult to figure out who is going against the community, and communities have more freedom for their participants.  At the same time, if there are too many would-be defectors a community can never get off the ground.

Communities need cooperation to work.  So how can we get this cooperation to fly?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Four Pressures of Cooperation</h2>
Bruce Schneier notes that normally we don't think through these free rider problems and try to scheme our way through them -- we just cooperate, instinctively.  We don't assume people will rip us off, and we usually don't rip other people off -- that's just how we are.  But why?  Schneier suggests that cooperation can be fostered and maintained through four different pressures, though differing kinds and amounts of pressure apply to different situations, and getting the balance of pressures right is a key part of his book:

<b>1.) Moral Pressures:</b> Many, but not all of us, have various moral feelings that lead us to want to cooperate.  It could be as easy as feeling incredibly guilty when we defect against our friends, or as complex as subscribing to an abstract principle of justice like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology">deontology</a>.  For most of us, it's a general feeling that cooperating is the "right thing to do" and defecting for our own personal self-interest is "wrong", and we just don't want to do it.  Schneier and Benkler both find that moral pressures compel cooperation a surprising amount of the time.

<b>2.) Reputational Pressures:</b> Another part about living in a community for a long time is that you have a reputation to live by.  Defect against the community and you may win a few times, but then people start to notice and start working to stop you.  They might refuse you friendship or other things you want, or even kick you out of the community altogether!  Benkler finds that many communities can thrive on reputation alone, like eBay, Amazon, or Reddit.

<b>3.) Institutional Pressures:</b> Morals and reputation aren't the end of it though; many communities make specific, codified norms and enforce them with specific, codified punishments.  These pressures are laws, and the fear of breaking the law, being caught, and getting the punishment can often further spur cooperation.  Best yet, the community can often get together and agree to these norms, realizing it is in their individual benefit to force themselves and the rest of the community to play along, as to avoid tragedies of the commons.

<b>4.) Security Pressures:</b> Lastly, there are always going to be a few people who put morals, reputation, and laws aside and try to defect anyway.  For these, we hope to stop them in their tracks or make their jobs more difficult, by using complex security systems.  It can be as simple as a security camera or anti-theft radio, or as complex as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Knox">Fort Knox</a>.  Security is a double plan: it first attempts to raise the costs of defection; by making it physically harder to defect, one is less tempted to do so.  It then attempts to better catch and apprehend those who still try.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Your Reason for Joining; Your Reason for Staying</h2>
Remember these pressures don't all work for the same problems -- it may be proper to use security and institutional pressures to stop someone from overfishing, but not from intentionally cutting the cake so they get to eat the bigger slice.  Moral and reputational pressures seem to be more encompassing, but they are also more easily defeated -- people with less of a moral compass can often wander from community to community, wrecking small amounts of havoc and never getting caught or punished.

Benkler suggests another way to get people to buy into a community and not defect against it -- make it clear that being part of the community is something they really want.  Whether your joining a community or forced into one (family, country, etc.), the community will be more likely to thrive.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Four Ways to Bond</h4>
But why might one want to join or stay in a community?  For many, the answer is the intangibles -- they feel a sense of belonging, friendship, and group cohesion that creates an empathetic attachment and makes people want to play by the rules of the group.  For others, the answer is the tangibles -- the group may have a stated mission statement that is important to the person, or belonging in the group might confer a specific benefit.  People might even belong for a mix of tangibles and intangibles, plus a natural tendency to want to join groups.

But how do we foster these bonds?  Benkler has his own set of four things, suggesting that group identity can be fostered through a combination of four means:

<b>1.) Fairness:</b> The community needs to be fair -- people need to all contribute more or less equally, or at least have genuine intentions to put in equal effort, and the benefits of the group need to be spread among all participants more or less evenly, or in a fair proportion to how much the participant puts in.

<b>2.) Autonomy:</b> The community needs to not demand too much, and make sure to compensate quickly and generously for special sacrifices.  There are inherent costs to joining and staying with a group, and costs for cooperating with the group -- one doesn't just give up the self-interested benefits of defection, but rather must pay additional costs to maintain their group status.  Being aware of and addressing these costs are important.  In short, the group must respect their members as individuals.

<b>3.) Democracy:</b> The community also needs to accept (with fairness and autonomy) the input of all the members.  Group norms should be developed by a vote, with weight given on building consensus as much as possible, and with understanding the reasons why people might not like the consensus.  Not only does having input make it more likely people's preferences will be taken into account, lowering the costs of cooperation, but having input makes people feel more group cohesion and belonging.

<b>4.) Communication:</b> During times when formal votes aren't taken, the community also needs to be consistently (but not constantly) talking about how the group is doing, and checking in with members who might be feeling left out.  Just like democracy, group cohesion is built through communication, and communication lowers the costs of cooperation.  It's best when resolving disputes is not dictatorial, like in a court of law, but rather cooperative, like in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration">arbitration</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Looking Back to the Public Goods Game</h2>
To demonstrate these four points, Benkler draws on many real-world examples, such as policies of various companies, and interactions on the internet.  He also draws on returning back to our simple-community-in-the-lab, the Public Goods Game, for additional confirmation, and its worth seeing how these things play out.

In the original Public Goods game, contributions to the pot were made anonymously and no-one was allowed to talk or communicate.  Typically, a fair amount of people would cooperate in the beginning (generally, people contribute about 70% of their share), but starts to drop as people see that others aren't contributing.  They start to feel like suckers, and the fairness starts to kick in.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A Different Game</h4>
However, variants of the Public Goods game offer ways out.  When participants were allowed to talk to each other, contributions rose (communication).  Likewise, when participants were allowed to use some of their money to punish those who didn't contribute (say, pay $3 to prevent someone from getting their share this round if they didn't cooperate last round), people would do so.  

Even the simple act of making the contributions public increased cooperation, drawing on reputation.  Sometimes small fines were imposed on those who didn't cooperate (institutional pressures) which brought up cooperation, and these fines worked especially well when the group got to vote on how high they would be (democracy).

Lastly, helping frame the game would help -- those who were told they were taking place in a "Community Game" were far more likely to contribute to the pot and keep contributing than those who were told they were taking place in a "Wall Street Game".  By reminding people they are in a community, people thought more about their community norms, and felt more group cohesion, and were more likely to trust others.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
Ultimately, creating communities is all about fostering cooperation, and you foster cooperation by ensuring that there is mutual trust and some sort of way to prevent defectors from taking advantage of the system.  People often naturally don't want to defect, but will do so if they think others will take advantage of them first.

<b>Social Pressures</b>
But how do we foster this trust?  The first step is to make use of our social pressures when and to the amount that's appropriate -- relying on empathetic and moral norms, reputation, institutionalized laws, and security systems -- and being sure to get the balance right.  For small communities, this probably just needs to be a set of agreed norms, and ensuring that the norms are properly and responsibly enforced.

<b>The Benefits of Joining</b>
The second part is while implementing the first step, we should keep in mind why people are joining or staying in the first place, and make sure to provide a community where the benefits of joining -- both the tangibles and intangibles -- are present and apparent.  We should acknowledge the costs of cooperating, and make sure the benefits are there to foster group loyalty and belonging.

<b>An Effective Community</b>
While implementing, it's important to keep in mind that communities should also be fair, respect the autonomy and individuality of the members, give members input through democracy, and foster lots of communication about how things are going.  We should also keep a keen eye to how things are framed, while not going overboard on it or lying.

<b>The End Reward</b>
But when we accomplish communities, the rewards are pretty great -- not only do we avoid free riders and the tragedy of the commons, but we ourselves get to take advantage of communities that are more productive than the individuals alone, and secure the feelings of belonging to a group we enjoy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the second edition of Sunday Links!  These are links!  And this is posted on a Sunday!  Makes sense so far, right?  As a reminder, I may not agree with everything said in all of these links.

...Positional goods are things you spend money on solely to prove how rich you are.  For example, buying a $2000 watch that isn't any better than a $100 one.  <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-moral-shortcomings-of-conspicuous-consumption-by-peter-singer">Peter Singer reminds us that such spending is somewhere between entirely wasteful and terribly evil</a>.  I wish more people could just go back to proving how rich they are by blowing it on ineffective philanthropy, because then it hopefully will take a lot less work to get them to channel it into effective philanthropy.

...In other Singer news, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEulhlGgskc">Peter Singer gives a talk about effective altruism</a>.  Luckily someone recorded it and put it on YouTube.  ...Too many of these awesome lectures aren't on YouTube.

....There's <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2012/08/13/live-by-statistics-die-by-statistics/">something a little suspicious</a> about the p<0.05 threshold.  Feel free to ignore this if you don't know what "p<0.05" means, but definitely read this if you do.  It's for us statistics people.  Speaking of which, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/nobel-laureate-challenges-psychologists-to-clean-up-their-act-1.11535">psychology might be screwed</a> for similar reasons.<!--more-->

...<a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201012/in-groups-out-groups-and-the-psychology-crowds">A bit of an intro on in-groups and out-groups</a>, and five ways to avoid falling into their trap: recognize the arbitrary nature of many ingroup-outgroup distinctions, put yourself in the place of the outgroup member, look for commonalities between opposing groups, build on your inner sense of security, and to pass along the lesson.  Includes a really interesting case about a teacher who was able to set her third-grade students against each other simply by grouping them by eye-color.  Something tells me that such an experiment won't get past the IRB anymore...

...<a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/10/03/a-tax-taxonomy/">The Tax Taxonomy</a>.  A cute name for a good analysis of various taxes and how regressive or progressive they are.

...Alonzo Fyfe of Atheist Ethicist does <a href="http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-myth-of-makers-and-takers.html">a pretty good take-down of the idea of "takers" and "makers"</a>, by pointing out that the typical "makers" / job creators are actually the beneficiaries of a lot of tax breaks and other various deals.

...Krugman reminds us that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/opinion/krugman-cheating-our-children.html">deficits are basically money we owe ourselves</a> and thus not the tremendous risk to our economy as they seem.

...<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lies_damned_lies_and_statistics_about_tedtalks.html">A TED talk about how to give a popular TED talk</a>.  Statistics and hillarity ensue.

...<a href="http://fakeisthenewreal.org/reform/">The US electoral map redrawn</a>, making "states" of equal population.  Interesting for both people that like maps and people that like electoral politics.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>To Inspire People to Give, Be Public About Your Giving</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people think it would be nicer if people were to give more money to non-profits, especially effective ones.  However, for most people, it doesn't even occur to them that they giving a large share of their salary to charity is something that people actually can do, or <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">that people are doing on a regular basis</a>.

Being public with one's pledge to donate not only spreads information about how easy it is to fight global poverty with a serious commitment, but that such commitments are the kind of thing that people can actually take.  By being public with these pledges, we can actually inspire people to give, where they otherwise wouldn't.

But how did people get stuck in a rut?  Why doesn't giving money come naturally?  And how would public declarations help dig people out of this rut?<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Bystander Effect and The Assumption of Self-Interest</h2>
First, to understand how to get people to give we have to understand why they currently do not.  There are <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-dont-people-help-others-more/">a number of reasons</a>, but one of the most prevalent is what's called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander Effect">bystander effect</a>.  While this effect is widely known in groups failing to respond to disasters right in front of their faces, it's magnified when the disaster is global poverty a continent or two away.  We think that because other people around us are not giving, it must also not be our responsibility, and we sure wouldn't want to be suckered into helping when no one else is doing their fair share.

Ever since Thomas Hobbes's <u>The Leviathan</u>, seeing human nature in terms of selfishness has been common, and persists to this day[1,2] as a strong and occasionally self-reinforcing belief[3,4].  People think of monetary incentives as being the most effective incentive for encouraging blood donations[5], even when this turns out to not be the case[6].  People greatly over-estimate the amount people will support a policy that favors them over other people[5].  As noted by Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835, "Americans enjoy explaining almost every act of their lives on the principle of self-interest"[7].

This leads us to a natural assumption that donating to charity is irrational... or, at least, other people aren't doing it, so neither should I.  However, this norm of self-interest is largely a myth, and people seem to do better than most people expect.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Challenging the Self-Interest Norm</h2>
This means the self-interest norm has to be challenged, and if it is challenged, we can expect people to revise their selfish-based theory of human nature and turn to more selfless acts like charitable giving.  If we're interested in getting people to donate more than what they already do, we need to open people up to the idea that charitable giving cannot only be virtuous but <i>expected</i>, and can be done not only at the typical rate of 1%, but at rates of 10% or much higher[8].  We also should challenge the norm that charity should be silent and not spoken about, and instead mention it openly and proudly[9].

People tend to conform, both intentionally and unintentionally, adopting the actions of others[4], and end up unwilling to adopt contrary actions unless other people are also going along with them.  If peer pressure can make high schoolers turn to drug use, alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, or even drop out of high school[10], surely it can stop people from giving.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
For example, take the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments">Asch Conformity Experiments</a>.  Here, people were in a group and asked to look at a line and compare its length to three other lines on another card, and state which line matches the height of the first line.  The task is enormously simple, but is complicated by being in a group of several other people, all in on the experiment, all who give the identical wrong answer.

Asch found that many people would conform to this wrong answer, even against their better judgement.  However, by adding another subject to this experiment who would give the correct answer, the tendency to conform would drop dramatically, even though the correct answer is still in the minority.  Take away the partner, even halfway through the experiment with the same subject, and conformity shoots back up.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
However, allowing people an escape from this norm can lead them to be able to increase their charitable donations.  In one field experiment, a radio station would mention to potential donors whenever a previous donor had donated $300, and they found that this increased donations by $13 more per person over the control condition, and these donors were also more likely to renew their memberships and donate more the next year compared to those in the control condition[11].

In a separate field experiment, donors gave more to a radio station when prompted with an amount that was higher than their previous contribution[12].  Lastly, a third field experiment found that student donors were more likely to give to funds for students when told that 64% of other students had donated than when they were told that 46% of other students had donated[13].

Overall, people are moved by seeing what others do, and can be tilted away from self-destructive norms by seeing other people go against the flow.  An organization like Giving What We Can making a public stand for giving can accomplish just that.  Make your giving public, and it should multiply as you inspire others.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Motivations and Fights for Status</h2>
Reflecting on the need to push up the norm to accurately reflect the giving nature of society, it seems like the pushback to privatize giving is harmful.  And I think it is.  But why does it come about in the first place?  <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/09/covert-virtue-the-signal-that-doesnt-bark.html">Robert Wiblin speculates</a> that being public about giving calls your motivations into question.  If you're only motivated by compassion for those in need, why do you need to boast?

Well, of course, there's an interest in raising the norm.  But let's assume that giving was really just a giant fight for status... would that be so bad?  All else being equal, I prefer pure intention to that of giving just to prove to others, but competing for status via donation oneupmanship is <i>considerably</i> more useful than competing for status via bigger houses, bigger cars, and bigger flatscreen TVs.

Or rather, people still end up competing over their charitable contributions, but it comes in the forms of significantly less-effective (though still arguably worthwhile) charitable competition, like <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2012-11-20">volunteering</a>, building schools, or adopting African children.  If, instead, we normalized people giving checks, at least more people could be helped while the status fight goes on.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Many people want to leave the world in a better place than they found it, perhaps even going as far as wanting to do the best they can.  To these people, I hope that the idea of donation, especially to <a href="http://givewell.org/giving101">effective causes</a> in <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html">potentially large amounts</a> ends up appealing.  But if this cool idea is seen as "boastful", it won't catch on, and won't get the publicity (I think) it deserves.

Moreover, people won't be able to network together and share information about more cost-effective charities or the latest trends in development economics, because everyone will be keeping it to themselves, ending up being collectively self-defeating.

We seem forced by society to pretend to be self-interested, because we're asked to not talk about our acts of kindness.  But this only goes to re-enforce the deadly cycle.  The only way to push ourselves out of this cycle is to demonstrate that some people do donate and push up this norm.  And groups like <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">GivingWhatWeCan</a>, <a href="http://www.80000hours.org">80000 Hours</a>, and <a href="http://www.boldergiving.org/">BolderGiving</a> are working on doing just that.

Personally, I'd have to agree that this works -- I'm inspired by these stories, and I don't think I would ever be donating 10%+ without a group that makes it seem like a completely normal and awesome thing to do.

So is talking about donations too boastful?  I think, for the sake of those the donations help, we can afford a little boasting in this one area.

				<title>Where You Give is Literally A Matter of Life and Death</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine you came across a store offering the following options:

<b>Blue Coffee Mug:</b> $1
<b>Red Coffee Mug:</b> $1050

After thorough inspection, you discover that both mugs are of precisely equal quality.  The only difference in the mugs is their color.  Which would you rather buy?

...I think nearly every person would — if they had to make the choice — prefer to buy the blue coffee mug. Even if red is your favorite color and the red coffee mugs are so more stylish than blue ones, the thousand-fold difference in the price just doesn’t seem to cut it, and red wins out in a landslide.

Now why does this matter?  Because, I’d argue, the same kind of decisions are made when we donate, except most people make little effort to figure out which coffee mug is which.  And instead of the downside being wasting your own money on a coffee mug that is far too expensive, <b>the downside of this mistake is that people die who otherwise wouldn't have to.</b><!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Doing More For the Same Cost</h2>
One of the most surprising findings is just how much difference there can be when giving the same amount of money to one organization or the other.  One can <b>cure</b> blindness for <b>one hundred</b> people in Africa <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2012-11-05">for the same cost</a> it takes to buy <b>one</b> seeing eye dog to <b>help</b> someone with blindness in America.

GiveWell, a non-profit evaluator, finds that <a href="http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas">one can save a life for $2500</a> by donating to <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/">the Against Malaria Foundation</a>, but the best opportunities in the United States take tens of thousands of dollars to help people out anywhere near as much.

How is this possible?  This isn't because the non-profits are wasteful or ineffective -- they're just working in the wrong area.  Africans have a lot more problems that can be treated a lot more easily because they lack a lot of wealth.  Keep in mind that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States">the median American family income</a> is about $45K, whereas <a href="http://www.salaryexplorer.com/salary-survey.php?loc=201&loctype=1">the median African family income</a> is definitely less than $10K.  Someone earning at the poverty line in the US <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/why-give/how-rich-am-i">is richer than</a> 90% of people in the world.  So, for example, the eye defects in Africa that occur at birth would have already been easily treated here in the US, but aren't treated in Africa because the families lack the resources to do so.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Urgency of Comparing Costs</h2>
Definitely one piece of writing that has inspired me a lot in my focus on utilitarianism and whole-heartedly deserves the respect it gets is Scott Alexander's <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/">"Efficient Charity: Do Unto Others..."</a>.  One of my favorite passages:

<blockquote>In the "Buy A Brushstroke" campaign, eleven thousand British donors gave a total of £550,000 to keep the famous painting "Blue Rigi" in a UK museum. If they had given that £550,000 to buy better sanitation systems in African villages instead, the latest statistics suggest it would have saved the lives of about one thousand two hundred people from disease. Each individual $50 donation could have given a year of normal life back to a Third Worlder afflicted with a disabling condition like blindness or limb deformity...

Most of those 11,000 donors genuinely wanted to help people by preserving access to the original canvas of a beautiful painting. And most of those 11,000 donors, if you asked, would say that a thousand people's lives are more important than a beautiful painting, original or no. But these people didn't have the proper mental habits to realize that was the choice before them, and so a beautiful painting remains in a British museum and somewhere in the Third World a thousand people are dead.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I think this bluntness captures my feelings of reservation with how most people in the world think about donation.  Personally, I'm really excited about art.  Art inspires me, and I think it's worth funding.  And I'm really excited whenever anyone decides they want to spend money on the well-being of others, regardless of how they choose to spend that money.  But at the same time, we must recognize that everything comes at a cost.

Economists would tell you that whatever you spend your money on, you are not spending your money on something else.  So I give a little sigh every time I hear about more philanthropic money being devoted to cultivating the arts, when so many people are in need.

In the essay <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/49-on-triage">"On Triage"</a>, Brian Tomasik asks us to imagine a military doctor who comes across a battlefield laden with hundreds of injured soldiers in severe pain, with backup medical units unable to arrive for quite some time  Should the doctor spend most of his limited supply of pain killer on the mildly injured patients nearest to him, even though many of those a bit farther away are in absolute agony?  Brian concludes:

<blockquote>[T]he answer ought to be ‘no’. Rather, triage - giving greatest medical attention to those who can be helped most in the least amount of time - represents the ethical imperative under these circumstances.  In the real world, though, we can’t do everything. Resources are limited, and we inevitably face choices between helping one being or another. Triage is not an act of harshness; it represents the highest form of mercy and compassion.</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Think back again to the coffee mugs.  Would you buy the $100 blue one over the $1 red one, when the only difference is color?  Now imagine you're faced with a choice of this:

<b>Fred Hollows Foundation - Cure blindness:</b> $40
<b>Guide Dogs of America - Train one seeing eye dog:</b> $42000

Sure, you can do a lot by deciding to give <i>more</i> money than you otherwise would.  If you previously only gave 1% of your income and now <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">you give 10%</a>, you're likely doing about 10x as much good.  But if you only gave 1% of your income and switched to the Fred Hollows Foundation instead of giving to the Guide Dogs of America, you're actually doing more than 100x as good.  And by failing to make that switch, 99 people are blind that otherwise didn't have to be. <i>...If only you did some more research</i>.

Does this mean we have to live in a world where no one funds the arts, all museums shutter their doors, all operas are cancelled, and we channel every last penny to cure blindness?  Definitely not.  There are definitely things that add far less value -- actual waste and excess -- that we should go after first.

Does this mean that Guide Dogs of America isn't doing good work?  Or, for that matter, that art museums aren't doing good work?  Not all.  They're doing excellent work!  However, we only have so much money, and in order to prevent people from dying of diseases or living lives of blindness, we must donate where our money goes the furthest.

Thus, if you're thinking of giving $100 to the arts, maybe you should consider giving a portion of that to the most cost-effective charities instead.  And if you're thinking of giving $100 to help out a problem, you definitely should consider doing some research to see if there is a far more effective way to solve that problem.

And it isn't even all that hard!  Organizations like <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>, and <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/">Effective Animal Altruism</a> spend full-time jobs searching for these cost-effective charities so you don't need to worry about it too much yourself.  Check them out!]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Sunday Links #3: Effective Altruism</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/sunday-links-3-effective-altruism/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the third edition of Sunday Links!  This time, I want to explore links on one particular concept: <i>effective altruism</i>, a concept near and dear to both my heart and utilitarianism.

Peter Singer summarizes effective altruism <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Diuv3XZQXyc">in his recent TED Talk</a>.

What's the key idea?  Will Crouch <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/node/4">defines effective altruism</a> as starting with a "how" (a desire to do as much good as possible) and moving to a "what" (whatever does the most good), instead of the typical model of altruism, which starts with a "what" (ending cancer) and moving to a "how" (whatever campaigns end cancer).  It's very closely related to the idea of <a href="http://www.tacticalphilanthropy.com/2010/10/the-rise-of-issue-agnostic-philanthropy/">issue-agnostic philanthropy</a>.

Perhaps the biggest take away is that philanthropy involves trade-offs, because donating in one place means we're not donating in another place.  However, because our money could have gone further elsewhere, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">we end up hurting people unintentionally</a>.  My favorite case for understanding the need for effective altruism involves Scott Siskind's <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/">summary of efficient charity</a>, which I referenced before.  To make the idea of opportunity costs in spending apparent, Scott Siskind also jokingly suggests <a href="http://www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html">we adopt dead child currency</a>.

One example of effective altruism is to <a href="http://www.givewell.org/want-to-change-peoples-lives-give-internationally">focus more on the developing world than on the developed world</a>.  This might seem unintuitive at first, but when I think about it <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/49-on-triage">in terms of triage</a> or Julia Wise's <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2012/02/our-worst-subjects.html">notion of worst subjects</a>, it makes sense to me.  Jeff Kaufman's <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2011-10-15">debate with a pro-local friend of his</a> also helps.

But wouldn't this be really hard?  Well, the secret is that <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/why-give/how-rich-am-i">we're rich</a>, compared to the developing world.  But even so, <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/03/it-doesnt-have-to-be-hard.html">it doesn't have to be hard</a>.  You could just start <i>somewhere</i>, for some amount.

Where should you start?  I recommend a few places, like <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com">The Life You Can Save</a>, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>. <a href="http://80000hours.org">80000 Hours</a>, and <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/">Effective Animal Activism</a>.

There's much more that needs to be said, but this should be enough to get you going.  A whole world of helping more by "working smarter, not harder" awaits.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Failures of Foreign Aid (And Some Potential Fixes)</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/the-failures-of-foreign-aid-and-some-potential-fixes/</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 04:00:47 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">previously mentioned</a> that individuals can make a large difference in the lives of others through donations, as long as they choose very cost-effective charities.  However, while our donation does make a difference to a few people, there are much more massive institutions working to make much bigger differences in the well-being of those in other countries -- <i>foreign aid</i>.

Foreign aid aims to eliminate extreme hunger, extreme poverty, and disease from the world altogether and usher everyone into lives in which they can be happy and live to their potential.  Because foreign aid is perhaps the biggest attempt to make the world a better place, it is important to me that we get this right.

Unfortunately, we haven't gotten it right quite yet.  Fifty years of foreign aid efforts later, and extreme poverty, extreme hunger, and disease still exist.  While it may seem wildly idealistic to believe that extreme poverty, extreme hunger, and disease can be eliminated soon, Peter Singer in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-You-Can-Save/dp/1400067103"><b>The Life You Can Save</b></a> argues that the elimination of all three plights is within our reach if only we studied foreign aid, looked at its failures, and made some modifications.  In this essay, I explore his chapter on foreign aid.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Much Aid?</h2>
Peter Singer starts off by quoting a prominent foreign aid critic, William Easterly, who makes the following argument:

<blockquote><span>The West spent $2.3 trillion on foreign aid over the last five decades and still had not managed to get twelve cent medications to children to prevent half of all malaria deaths.  The West spent $2.3 trillion and still had not managed to get four-dollar bed nets to poor families....It's a tragedy that so much well-meaning compassion did not bring these results for needy people.</span></blockquote>

However, as Peter Singer notes, $2.3 trillion on foreign aid over five decades is 46 billion a year, which distributed over all developed nations works out to $60 per person per year, or 0.3% of the economic output of these nations (30 cents per $100).  In 2006, America was one of the least generous developed nations, giving 0.18% of GDP -- though America still gave the most at the dollar by dollar level, sending $27 billion overseas.  Other nations, like Sweden, give closer to 1% of their GDP.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Misconceptions About the Quantity of Aid</h4>
Still, billions of dollars a year sounds like an awful lot, though it's also equally fair to describe it as $90 per person, per year -- less than people tend to typically donate on their own from their after tax income, and much less than people give up in taxes.

Interestingly, the American population <i>feels</i> like a lot more goes to foreign aid than 0.18% of the GDP.  Peter Singer quotes a poll done by the University of Maryland, which asked 848 respondents "What percentage of the federal budget goes to foreign aid?".  <b>The median answer was 25%</b>, or $900 billion annually (the US budget has typically been $3.6 trillion per year), or $3000 per person -- more than 33 times larger than the actual budget.

More interestingly, these same respondents were asked how much they thought the government <i>should</i> spend on aid.  Here, the median response was for the government to <b>slash the aid budget down to 10%</b>, or <i>13 times larger than it actually is</i>.  At 10% of GDP, the aid budget would work out to $360 billion annually, or $1200 per person.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Actual Cost of Aid</h4>
Whether $900 billion annually or $27 billion annually, these numbers for aid -- both potential and actual -- mean little without a baseline to compare them to.  Just how much would it actually cost to do what William Easterly suggests -- use medications and bednets to prevent half of all malaria deaths?

To consider the cost, Peter Singer looks to a more broad initiative -- the <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">United Nations Millenium Goals</a>, a UN-lead project to "Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; Achieve universal primary education; Promote gender equality and empower women; Reduce child mortality rates; Achieve universal access to reproductive health; Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other disease; Ensure environmental sustainability; and Develop a global partnership for development".  One of these subgoals is to prevent half of all malaria deaths.

The World Bank has <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/html/extdr/mdgassessment.pdf">estimated that in order to meet these goals</a>, it would require around $60 billion per year for twenty-five years.  For the United States to do this alone, this would work out to $200 per person, and require roughly 2% of the US budget.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Politicization of Aid</h2>
So even if our aid was solely focused on the Millenium Development Goals, it still would fail because its simply not large enough.  But the Millenium Development Goals isn't the only target for America's foreign aid, nor really would I be prepared to argue that humanitarian goals would even require us to do so.

However, Peter Singer does spend some of his chapter arguing that the way America picks its foreign aid targets isn't the most <i>humanitarian</i>.  Instead, it's all about... <i>politics</i>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Who Benefits</h4>
During the Cold War, the politics of aid was at its height -- money was spent on other countries not to reduce poverty or fight disease, but rather to tilt countries away from Soviet influence.  Peter Singer writes about hundreds of millions of dollars that was given directly to a Congolese dictator, and all that money was included in Easterly's $2.3 trillion figure.  Obviously, those hundreds of millions did little to help meet the Millenium Development Goals.

Likewise, in 2008 the top recipients of US Aid are Iraq, Israel, Egypt, and Afghanistan -- together, these four nations receive 24.7 billion of the 27 billion, or 91% of the budget.  Heck, Iraq alone receives the lion's share 68% of the budget (18.44 billion).  Again, it's clear that these nations are the target of aid not because they are the most poor or most in need, but because -- even though they have more than a fair share of legitimate humanitarian problems -- they are key countries in the War on Terror.  It's no coincidence that all these nations are near or in the Middle East.

Now, the point that Peter Singer and I are making is not that it's unfair for nations to make their aid conditional to political goals.  It's just to point out that primarially political aid should not be criticized for failing at <i>humanitarian</i> goals -- because humanitarian goals are just not what we have in mind.  And that's something we need to own up to.  The humanitarian goals need more work.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How They're Benefitted</h4>
Another political problem with US foreign aid that Singer points out is that our aid is focused on indirectly benefitting the US. -- Congress requires that US aid be in the form of US goods transported on US ships.  A government agency that intends to stop the spread of AIDS in Africa by distributing condoms must buy these condoms from American manufacturers and load them onto American ships -- even though this would cost more than twice as much as doing the same with Asian manufacturers and Asian ships, or by building the necessary industries in Africa and using those industries to employ Africans themselves.

It gets worse when you consider that of food.  Politics requires that food aid be in the form of government subsidized US goods shipped on US ships. This results in food being dumped in Africa at great shipping expense and displacing the local market, resulting in less income for African farmers.

Instead, the same corn could have been bought in Africa without shipping costs and other overhead costs, getting income directly to African farmers instead of taking it away from them.  While a boon to American business, inefficient regulations like these can mean that spending $27 billion a year is often the equivalent of $7 billion a year or less.  When economic and political goals are swapped with humanitarian goals, its no wonder the humanitarian goals suffer.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Corruption, Dependence, Institutions, and Millenium Villages</h2>
While Singer points out that aid is insufficient at cutting extreme poverty, extreme hunger, and disease because it is (1) too small, (2) badly directed, and (3) badly structured, he also argues that aid critics go too far by suggesting that all aid is caught up by corrupt governments and/or that it just creates dependency.  The reason for this is that it is ignorant of how aid actually works.

Sure, giving money directly to the poor might breed dependency and giving money directly to certain governments might enrich only the warlords.  That's why foreign aid money is mostly neither given directly to the people or the government (though a lot of money in the past certainly was, which is more reason why Easterly's $2.3 trillion over fifty years figure failed to eradicate poverty forever).

As an example of effective foreign aid, Singer points us to the <a href="http://www.millenniumvillages.org/">United Nations Millenium Villages Project</a>.  This was a project to provide simple interventions to put extremely poor people on paths to sustainable growth that would continue even after the Millenium Villages Project stopped.  Some of these interventions involve the creation of village-run institutions to decide how aid is spent that must involve the input of women, programs to purify drinking water, vitamin and mineral supplements, immunization, bed nets to prevent malaria, new technology like stoves and energy production, and deworming to rid people of internal parasites.

Another example program Singer mentions is offering fertilizer and better seeds to farmers  that will improve their agricultural productivity, and farmers in return are required to give a portion of their increased harvest to a program that would feed schoolchildren -- continuing the cycle to improve nourishment and school attendance.  The project makes sure to require village buy-in, focuses on the long-run, focuses on changing things at the institution-level, and works to create sustainable change.  It's very different from the drop money and run approach that would create dependency and corruption.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
Singer points to several failures in foreign aid with humanitarian goals -- not enough money is being spent, and the money that is being spent is not on the countries that need it the most or on the most effective methods.  Instead, too little money is being spent on wildly ineffective measures.  Yet, Singer offers foreign aid a way out to meet its humanitarian mission: work on funding more proven interventions at much higher rates, and end the counterproductive regulations and food subsidies.

Singer, being consistent with a more politically liberal tradition, even suggests an easy place foreign aid money could come from: <i>slightly higher taxes</i>.  Consider the proposed <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-38045102/millionaires-tax-how-much-will-it-raise/">Millionaires' Tax</a>, a 5.4% additional tax on all incomes over a million dollars in the US.

The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated this would bring in roughly an extra $42 billion per year, which combined with the current aid budget would be enough to fully fund the Millenium Development Goals with an extra $9 billion annually left over.  Another way to get the $60 billion per year would be to just cut the US Defense Budget by 10%.

Now, I don't suggest that any of these changes would be wise -- I just do this to suggest that making very serious and significant strides toward eliminating extreme poverty, extreme hunger, and disease is possible, with equally serious and significant changes in our priorities.  Remember that $60 billion annually is a simple $200 per person per year in the United States.  Such an amount is hardly out of our reach.

				<title>In Non-Profits, Who Is The Customer?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For-profit organizations (better known as <i>businesses</i>) are in many ways much more simple than non-profit organizations.  When it comes to a pizza place, their goal is to sell me a delicious cheese pizza for $12.95 and my goal is to find the most delicious cheese pizza I can with my $12.95.  When our goals overlap, I give them my money and they give me their pizza.

<b>For businesses, knowing you are successful is also easy</b> -- the critical metric of profit is hitting the business in the face every time the cash register opens, and it's easy to document whether it's going up or down.  We can tell if a business is successful just by looking at these numbers, and we have no need for randomized controlled trials to see if making pizza is <i>really</i> the cause of profit, or if a pizza place could remain profitable without selling anything.

<b>Also for businesses, you are automatically accountable for failure.</b>  In bigger companies, you get fired by your shareholders.  Or, you simply stop finding yourself having enough money to pay salaries and keep the place open.  If your product isn't serving it's customers, you quickly go out of business.  You don't have to notice if you're doing bad, because doing badly will just catch up with you.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Non-Profits Are Not Businesses</h2>
Very little of this is true in non-profit organizations.  David Damberger is an engineer in <a href="http://www.ewb-usa.org/">Engineers Without Borders</a>.  He was tired of working on engineering printers to print at an extra two pages per minute, and instead wanted to work on projects that mattered, like ensuring that everyone had access to clean water.

However, Damberger explains in his TEDTalk entitled <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/david_damberger_what_happens_when_an_ngo_admits_failure.html">"What Happens When An NGO Admits Failure"</a>, that this mission of clean water has not been successful.  It's sad to hear that many water projects were developed to bring water, but then broke down barely two years later due to no-one to maintain them.  Then, instead of coming to fix these old water projects, organizations would just build entirely new projects from scratch, and these would also break down just two years later.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
But why do non-profits regularly fail?  In short, its because they aren't businesses:

<b>In non-profits, unlike business, knowing you are successful is hard.</b> It's easy to see if you're making a pizza people will buy, but it's hard to see if you're closing the achievement gap, or lowering poverty.  Things like these are impacted by many different factors, impact takes awhile to show up, and if it does, it's hard to know if it was <i>your particular program</i> -- or even any program, and not just statistical noise.  If you're succeeding or failing, these problems are so complex and poorly understood that it's hard to know.

<b>Likewise, non-profits are not automatically accountable to failure.</b> Businesses get money from those who use their services, but non-profits get money from people who do not use their services.  Money comes from donors, but products are given to others, such as the disadvantaged students or the extremely poor -- and these people may lack the knowledge or resources to communicate how things are doing.  Furthermore, donors don't get the first-hand experience of whether things are going better, but have to rely on communications from non-profits in the form of mailings.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Non-profits have trouble being accountable because their success is hard to measure, and they don't get money from the people who they provide for.  The customer for a for-profit business is clear -- it's the buyer.  I give them the $12.95 they want, and they give me the pizza I want.

<b>In the non-profit world, there are two different pools of customers</b> -- the people in need (beneficiaries) who receive help from the non-profit organization, and the donors who fund the non-profit activities.  These two customer pools don't overlap, it's the beneficiaries who are in the best position to know what they need, but the donors who keep the organizations accountable through funding.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Non-Profits Cannot Be Businesses</h2>
The obvious solution to this problem would be to turn non-profits into businesses.  But this would be a case where the obvious is wrong, <b>because non-profits cannot be businesses.</b>  While businesses can do much to contribute to social causes related to their field, nearly every charitable goal is long-term and not something from which any profit can be made.  Instead, one would expect to spend lots of money without getting any return for years.  That's why charitable causes are for charities that are motivated by <i>social returns</i>, not those looking to make a quick buck.

But there are a couple solutions that could bring more accountability to the non-profit world and break out of the cycle of development failure.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Be A Savvier Donor</h4>
Damberger points to non-profits who focus on having little overhead costs.  This creates the attractive message that every dollar  donated goes directly to helping those in need, but it means that critical things aren't being funded, like maintenance.  Why focus on having little overhead instead of funding what is needed to actually help in a sustainable way?  Well, because donors currently don't want that, and the only things that go forward are what people are willing to fund.

Non-profits are directly accountable to their donors -- and it is only the donors who can ensure money is put to effective programs.  Thus, donors have to use this responsibility wisely, and not fall into common traps like "little overhead" that perpetuate unsustainability and waste.

Engineers Without Borders has taken this and pushed back against this with a motto "It's not sexy, but it works".  The most effective organizations aren't always the ones with the most compelling, heart-wrenching stories.  Instead, the charitable causes are often won by boring things, like statistics.  No one said giving effectively would be easy.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Failure: Admit, Embrace, and Learn</h4>
Demberger talks about a lack of coordination within the development community, and a failure to learn from failure.  Hiding failure (because it might upset donors) results in these failures being unknowingly repeated again and again, potentially harming rather than helping.  At the same time, the scariness of failure makes non-profits risk-adverse, and thus puts pressure to maintain the status quo, potentially reinforcing already failed methods.

Demberger and others set up <a href="http://www.admittingfailure.com">AdmittingFailure.com</a> in order to document failures in the development world, and ensure "that we learn from failures instead of repeat them — that we are failing forward".  The website allows people to publish and discuss stories about failures, and then embrace them and learn from them.

As the website <a href="http://www.admittingfailure.com/about/why/">puts it</a>:

<blockquote><span>By admitting our failures, we end failure cycles and begin a linear progression of failing forward. It’s why this site exists. We’re on the same side, if not the same team. We’re working towards a common goal. By sharing what doesn’t work, we collectively accelerate the process of finding what does.</span></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Social Impact Bonds</h4>
Lastly, another interesting way to bring more accountability to non-profits is a pay-for-success model known as "Social Impact Bonds".  Tina Rosenberg, writing for the Fixes Column article <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/the-promise-of-social-impact-bonds/?nl=opinion&amp;emc=edit_ty_20120620">"The Promise of Social Impact Bonds"</a>.

Here's the model.  First, raise a couple million dollars from investors to fund a social program.  If the social program does not meet its target, the investors don't get any money back.  But if the social program meets its target, the state government pays the investors back all their funds plus interest, with more interest depending on how much the program beats its target.

Best yet, the targets for success will be tied to hard-to-measure numbers that actually matter (in this example, recidivism rates of prisoners who receive councilling, nut just the number of people who enter the program), and control for common biases (like sampling effects).

By getting these measures out there in front of the non-profits, and making sure that the non-profits only get funded if they succeed on these metrics, the accountability is greatly increased...

...kind of like a business.  Except, with savvy donors who embrace failure and focus on long-term social change.  Perhaps while they eat a pizza.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Follow up to: <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/resolutions-update-may-edition">Resolutions Update - May Edition</a></b>

More than five months ago, I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions">outlined some New Years Resolutions</a>, and then did what I thought impossible -- used the power of blogging, precommitment, and betting to <i>actually stick to my plans</i>.  Following up <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/resolutions-update-may-edition/">my last report in May</a>, I present my June update, where I see how I'm doing against my goals, and... more importantly... <i>update</i> my goals based on how things are going so far.

Also, this one ended up being a bit long.  Sorry.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Half-Year Swerve: A New Tracking Method</h2>
For the past five months, I've been tracking my resolutions <i>individually</i> and <i>independently</i>.  I'd set a blogging goal and make sure I write a certain amount of essays, set a diet goal and make sure I accomplish certain calorie and protein counts, set a finance goal and make sure I only spend so much money, etc.  Each of these goals succeeded or failed on it's own -- I could be doing very well at sticking to my diet, but be completely failing at remembering to brush my teeth, for example (as was frequently the case).

However, this recently has stopped working out as much as I'd like.  I got annoyed at the "all or nothing" feeling of some of these goals, especially when failure didn't really feel like my fault.  For one example, my diet goal included three subgoals: (1) eat less than 2438kcal to ensure I lose weight, (2) eat at least 56g of protein each day, and (3) drink at least 2.5 liters of water each day.

However, this summer I've been on an intensive summer program where I don't get much control over what is available to eat, and thus have struggled in finding protein-rich food offerings.  In my old system, this would mean that even though I drank enough water and didn't eat too many calories, the fact that I was 10g of protein under meant I failed "dieting" for the entire day.

That wasn't cool.  I felt some stress from not knowing how to count that, because I either succeeded or didn't -- I had no term for 90% success on the day.  Moreover, once I knew I was doomed to fail for the day, I felt like there was no point in keeping up the other subgoals, and stopped drinking as much water and started to snack on some more calories than I otherwise would.  While by the end of the week I will finally have control over my own diet again, this month, I want to try something different.

Therefore, I'm going to split up all my categories into individual goals and give them point values.  I will then tally up the points for each day and try to hit a certain target <i>for the month as a whole</i>.  This allows me to have really good days cancel out bad days, have my system reward me for going above and beyond, and not getting punished too much for missing one small part of a larger goal.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
After a bit of deliberation, this is what I landed upon, with point values:

<b>Fitness and Diet Goals</b>
<ul>
<li><b>20 points</b> for every <b>30 minutes I spend exercising</b>, but I can only claim up to 60 points per day this way and must take two rest days a week.</li>
<li><b>15 points</b> for each <b>30 minutes I spend walking</b>, but I can only claim up to 45 points per day this way.</li>
<li><b>10 points</b> if I <b>drank 2.5L water</b> for the day.  I can get a share of this for coming close (i.e. drinking 2L of water gives me 8 points).</li>
<li><b>20 points</b> if I <b>eat <2174kcal</b> for the day.</li>
<li><b>10 points</b> if I <b>eat >56g protein</b> for the day.  Again, I can get a share of this for coming close.</li>
<li><b>10 points</b> if I <b>eat at least one fruit and one vegetable</b> for the day.</li>
</ul>

<b>Hygeine Goals</b>
<ul>
<li><b>15 points</b> if I <b>take a shower</b> using both soap and shampoo.</li>
<li><b>10 points</b> for each time I <b>brush my teeth</b>, up to twice a day.</li>
<li><b>10 points</b> for each time I <b>floss</b>, up to twice a day.</li>
<li><b>-10 points</b> if I go to bed and the room is messy.</li>
</ul>

<b>Time Management Goals</b>
<ul>
<li><b>10 points</b> if I <b>wake up before 8:30a</b>.</li>
<li><b>10 points</b> for each <b>30 minutes spent blogging</b>.</li>
<li><b>10 points</b> for each <b>30 minutes spent reading with a purpose</b> (i.e. a book from my reading list).</li>
<li><b>15 points</b> for each <b>30 minutes spent doing tasks from the to-do list</b>.</li>
<li><b>5 points</b> for each <b>30 minutes spent hanging out with friends or family</b>.</li>
<li><b>-10 points</b> for every 30 minutes I spend wasting time (i.e. playing video games, spacing out, or other mindless tasks).</li>
</ul>

<b>Accomplishments</b>
This point system captures a lot of what I want to do in the way of everyday habits, but I still want some accomplishments done by the end of the year, such as:
<ul>
<li>Write 200 blog essays</li>
<li>Add four games to <a href="http://www.peterhurford.com/games.html">the arcade</a></li>
<li>Get my drivers license</li>
</ul>

<b>The Key Part</b>
At the end of the month, I must have accrued a total of 10800 points (average 360 points per day), or I fail.  There are no consequences to this failure other than publicly owning up to it in the July update.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Commentary</h2>
This system gets it's inspiration from <a href="https://habitrpg.com/">Habit RPG</a>, <a href="http://www.beeminder.com">Beeminder</a>, and <a href="http://www.joesgoals.com/">Joes Goals</a>.  I didn't want to use any of the three, however, because I really liked my own custom point spread, which is something none of those systems let me do.  So I implemented this point system by hand in Excel instead.

I'd recommend you consider <a href="https://habitrpg.com/">Habit RPG</a> or <a href="http://www.joesgoals.com/">Joes Goals</a> before trying a complicated point system like mine.  Remember, the most important thing is <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/dont-take-my-advice-too-seriously/">you find something that works for you</a>, and it's probably better that you start simple.  Likewise, I'd recommend you do <a href="http://nosdiet.com/">the No S Diet</a> for awhile before you try to count calories precisely like I do.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overall Structure</h4>
I don't want to sell this short though, as a lot of thought went into how I structure this new system.  If you've been following my resolutions from the beginning, you'll see a lot of the same, some new additions, and some subtractions.

One of the most difficult things to do was to was come up with a point system that would allow me to mess up on protein one day, skip an exercise another day, or spend an entire day with friends and still succeed, yet not be able to do this too often.  I also didn't want to be able to, for example, be able to eat like crazy and ignore my calorie goal but always make up for it in more time spent doing tasks.

Therefore, I put a lot of points on diet and hygiene, even though they wouldn't take too much time, to make it very profitable that I do them each day, but still require so many points that I still would have to work on the to-do list.  The rest was a further matter of priorities.  I want myself to see my friends (5pts per 30min) more than I want myself to read aimlessly on the internet (0pts), but I can't spend every day seeing friends, so I made working the to-do list (15pts per 30min) rank higher.  It's going to be a work in progress and I might retool the points for next month.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Exercise, Diet, and Hygeine</h4>
These categories are the same, except with four changes.

First, I dropped my calorie maximum from 2438kcal to 2174kcal both because as you lose weight you must bring the number down and because I wanted to see if I could lose weight faster.  At my current weight of 181lbs, following this should lead to a loss of about a pound a week.

Second, looking at my <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/cronometervitamins.png">Cronometer logs</a>, I need to work on my vitamins.  I don't really want to set a goal for each vitamin quite yet, so I decided to go with something very simple -- make sure I get fruit in my diet by eating at least one fruit a day.  I also wanted to keep up with vegetables, so I got my new "one fruit, one vegetable" rule.

Third, I split up showering, teeth brushing, and flossing into separate categories.  Sometimes, I only want to brush my teeth once and not floss during that day.  I want that to make for a loss of points, but not ruin the entire goal.

Fourth, I decided to implement the clean room as a negative point system (kind of like Habit RPG does).  I wanted to frame the system as much as I could in positive points, because earning points for me is far more appealing than having points taken away.  But I didn't think "clean room" every day or three times a week was a good habit.  Instead, it should be clean and <i>stay clean</i>, always, and this was the most elegant implementation of that old goal of mine.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Time Management</h4>
Time management isn't too different than before.  Rather than stick to a set four hour goal like I've previously done, I let my time flow over my entire day, allowing me to go above and beyond and make up for other failures, which is really rewarding.  Previously, I would always stop trying after four hours unless I had a project due the next day, because I knew I wouldn't be rewarding myself for it.  Now, I'll always have a reason to do more.

The next part was to break things up by priority.  Time usage would accrue no points by default, but I'd reward myself for certain things that are definitely worth doing, according to my priorities.  One odd difference is "reading with a purpose" -- I take this to not include reading <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/blogroll">my daily websites</a>, but rather reading things that specifically help me, like <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-reading/">my reading list</a> or researching.  Already, rewarding this has lead me to start reading books, whereas I previously didn't do much reading.

Time wasting is for things that are truly mindless, like time spent playing video games, that have absolutely no benefit.  This is the biggest room for grey area.  Things like reading the internet aimlessly or watching television are actually 0 points rather than -10, because they at least provide some benefit.  I might have to define this category more if I run into problems here.

Lastly, I wanted to start trying to wake up early, because I think there are benefits to early rising.  I hope to get into this in future essays.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What's No Longer Here: Finances</h4>
I previously had a goal to not spend more than $2000 for the year and to earn at least $6200 by the end of the year.  Both of these goals have become a bit unrealistic.  I have to furnish an apartment and pay for my own food for senior year (meaning expenses will be up) and I won't be getting paid much this summer (meaning expected income is way down), both of which I didn't anticipate when laying these goals.  Therefore, I'm taking finances out of the picture for this month (but I'll still continue to be frugal and look for reasonable income opportunities), reassess how things look for the future, and add them back in for July or August.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Last Month's Performance and Settling My Bet</h2>
It's not enough to just talk about the new, however -- I also should talk about the old.  It seems like this past month must be a failure if I'm implementing something new, but it actually was rather successful.  I only messed up on my diet once, on exercise once, and on brushing teeth twice.  According to my betting mechanism, this means I must send $5 over to the GOP, which is much better than $20 from last month.  <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/payingup.png">I have done so.</a>

However, I'm going to try this month of June without betting.  I'm feeling a bit odd about <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/anticharity/">what my donation might be accomplishing</a> and whether it's a net positive to siphon off money like this to make myself commit more.  I'm hoping that I'll do well with the psychological desire to (a) acquire points and (b) not publicly write about failure that I won't need any further way of committing myself.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
I've recently been really proud of my ability to use these Resolutions to truly change myself to be better in ways that I had not been able to motivate myself before.  I've lost almost 30 pounds, am in the best shape of my life, and am more productive each day than I ever was before, and I still have time for friends and family.  I procrastinate less, eat less junk food, and get bored less.  Things are really working out well.

I'm also proud of my ability to be <i>iterative</i> and improve on my Resolutions each month to build new habits and more effectively re-enforce old ones.  This is starting to become an extraordinarily powerful tool, and I'm interested in how this point system will move things forward, or if I'll shift back into my old category-by-category system.

A lot more can be said about this, and a lot more will in future essays.  But for now, I'll end with a word of warning to those who might follow in my footsteps -- watch out for the complexity.  This started as a journey with simple origins -- a pledge to eat less, exercise more, and be more productive.  It didn't start as a complex mess of points added up in an Excel spreadsheet -- that came five months later.  If you want to start one of these journeys for yourself, I'd suggest you start out simple and grow your way from there.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Among those people interested in doing as much as they can to make the world a better place and think donating their money as effectively as possible is a good way to do that, there is a debate about whether one should either (a) donate a specific portion of one's income in small installments each year or (b) invest one's income and then donate as much as possible in one large lump sum right before death.  Of course, there are other positions -- like donate every month or donate every decade, but in a very relevant sense the debate is between two options: "give now" vs. "give later".

In this essay, I will defend the "give now" camp and rebut the "give later" camp, thus explaining why I will continue to donate once a year, though think any sort of regular time period smaller than each year is probably also acceptable.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>But First, Why Give Later?</h2>
The biggest champ for the "give later" crowd is Robin Hanson, who makes his view known most recently in <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/04/more-now-means-less-later.html">"If More Now, Less Later"</a>:

<blockquote>But at the margin, a person who saves another dollar, or chooses not to borrow another dollar, must typically expect the financial returns from their investments will help them more in the future than will such indirect effects of spending today. In fact, they should expect this savings will benefit their future self more than any of these other ways of spending today. After all, why give up money today if that both gives you less to spend today, and gives you less in the future? So there wouldn’t be any savings, or less than maximal borrowing, if people didn’t expect more gains later from saving than from spending today.

This implies that unless charity recipients are saving nothing and borrowing as much as they possibly can, they must expect that you would benefit them more in the future by saving and giving them the returns of your savings later, than if you had given them the money today, even after taking into account all of the ways in which their spending today might help them in the future. So there really must be a tradeoff between helping today and helping later; if you help more today, you help less in the future. At least if you help them in a way they could have helped themselves, if only they had the money.</blockquote>

Or, more basically, there are two concepts:

First, there is the <b>"growth rate"</b> of donation -- by donating to a non-profit <i>now</i>, they get to do things with your money <i>now</i>, helping people immediately who then could be in a better position to give back, or by spending money on dreaded "overhead" (<a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/16/which-of-these-boasts-is-not-like-the-others/">which isn't evil, by the way</a>, but that's a matter for another time), putting them in a better position to grow <i>now</i>.

Second, there is the <b>"investment rate"</b> of saving/investing your donation money rather than donating now.  This should be the easier of the two concepts -- you save your money, it grows in a certain percentage, and then right before you're about to die, you take all that money out and donate it.

And then to oversimpify the complex topic, you should be willing to donate now as long as you think "growth rate > investment rate", and save now as long as you think "investment rate > growth rate", plus a few other complications to be discussed.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ok, So What's The Investment Rate, Then?</h2>
Finding out the precise investment rate is complicated, but I think Jeff Kaufman has done some really good work on it in <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-04-06">"What Rates of Return Should You Expect?"</a>.  Basically, many sites suggest returns on investment between 6% and 12%, but this (a) ignores the average of 3% inflation, (b) involves cherry-picking, and (c) only focuses on US data.  Articles like The Economist's<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21571443-investors-may-have-developed-too-rosy-view-equity-returns-beware-bias">"Beware of the Bias"</a> point this out.

So if we're really optimistic, we could consider the investment rate to be 12% and if we're really pessimistic, we could consider it to be 0%, or lower!  But I'd expect the real (inflation adjusted) rate of return on your investment to be between 3 and 5%.  This means that if I had opted to instead take <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/donations-report">the $659.70 donation</a> I made last year and instead invested in it, given that I expect to live around 70 more years, I could realistically realize $5,372.94 to $21,687.36 if compounded monthly.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ok, So What's The Growth Rate, Then?</h2>
But what about the other side of the coin -- growth rate from your donation?  I see the potential size of this being huge.  Unlike the investment rate which I think is overestimated, the growth rate seems <i>underestimated</i>.

Honestly, whatever the growth rate is on your donation is going to depend largely and entirely on <i>where</i> you donate.  But if you're donating to advocacy, you could realize really large returns because of what's called <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration">the haste consideration</a>:

<blockquote>[I]magine two worlds:

(1) You don’t do anything altruistic for the next 2 years and then you spend the rest of your life after that improving the world as much as you can.

(2) You spend the next 2 years influencing people to become effective altruists and convince one person who is at least as effective as you are at improving the world. (And assume that this person wouldn’t have done anything altruistic otherwise.) You do nothing altruistic after the next 2 years, but the person you convinced does at least as much good as you did in (1).

By stipulation, world (2) is improved at least as much as world (1) is because, in (2), the person you convinced does at least as much good as you did in (1).</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Essentially, convincing just one person to do what you would do (go vegetarian, join Giving What We Can, etc.) as ardently as you would do it (or nearly as much) would have the same effect as your entire life's work.  Robin Hanson stated the case for giving later over giving now as "if more now, less later".

But with the haste consideration, it's actually <b>if more now, more later</b>, because you'll be convincing people to do things they would otherwise have <i>not done at all</i> (presumably).
<p>&nbsp;</p>
And you can donate money to convincing people -- by donating to <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org">Vegan Outreach</a> for veganism or <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> directly for donation outreach.  I have tried to calculate the <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">cost per converting a vegetarian elsewhere</a> and I'm told by Will MacAskill that, if I'm reading the spreadsheet he gave me right, it would cost an estimated $1779 to $4327 to acquire a new Giving What We Can member (I believe you can email him for details on that).

Thus, let's assume that, in my lifetime, I'll earn at least a $50K/year salary.  Now assume that it costs a conservative $10K/year to recruit a Giving What We Can lifetime, committed member (who will also earn at least a $50K/year salary).  I can either do two things:

(1) invest 10% of my salary each year at 5% return compounded monthly, and then, upon my death, buy as many committed GWWC members as possible.
(2) donate 10% of my salary each year to buy as many committed GWWC members as possible.

According to <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/article/investing-calculator/lifeandmoney_investing/#/entry_form">this investment calculator</a> (which I used earlier), option #1 will yield $3,200,782.84, which could buy 320 committed GWWC members.

Option #2 would add a committed member every two years, producing 45 committed GWWC members over my predicted 70 year lifespan.  This looks bad, but now remember that each of those members would then get a chance to recruit new members using <i>their</i> money.  The first person I get would then commit $340K of their own lifetime earnings over the remaining period (68 years, since I recruited them on year 2, at $5K/year contribution).  I'd only need to recruit ten members myself to dwarf the investment strategy, and that's not even counting all the second-stage members <i>those</i> first-stage members recruit.

At this point, I wish I was a math major and knew how to calculate this out with a simple formula.  Instead, I talked to a math major (who is also a GWWC member), and he mentioned that basically, the group effectively doubles over the two year period.  I save up to $10K at year two and recruit someone, and then in two years (year #4) we both have $10K and recruit someone, and then in two more years (year #6) all four of us recruit have $10K and recruit someone each, bringing the total amount of people recruited to twelve.  By year #70, I will have recruited, directly and indirectly, 1+2<sup>34</sup> people, or 17.1 billion new GWWC members.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Obviously, this is implausible because there aren't even 17 billion people and recruitment efforts would certainly be nonlinear. And there are other problems.  But it's a simple way to prove the point.  Hopefully this shows the benefit of compounding via the haste consideration to <b>recruit new people who wouldn't have donated their money otherwise.</b>

Even if Option #1 were considered to recruit people who then saved all their money and recruited other people, by year #140 it would only have 102,400 people recruited, whereas Option #2 would have roughly 10<sup>41</sup> people recruited.

Even if the growth rate isn't 100% every two years, it's considerably higher than 5%, I think.  Thus since growth rate > interest rate, I advocate donating now.  At least until someone finds the inevitable unobvious flaw in my thinking.

As Brian Tomasik argues in <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?t=824">"The Haste Consideration Reconsidered"</a>, we'll probably hit diminishing marginal returns on GWWC recruiting soon, and thus should reconsider our donation target, re-evaluate the growth rate, and maybe shift back to investing rather than donating.  But, <i>right now</i>, the prospects are still high and there are still many bright and active individuals who have not yet been recruited.  Right now, we can use our money to make sure they use their money better.

Thus my answer to Robin Hanson: More (of our money) now, more (of their money) later.  At least, while it lasts.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Other Complications</h2>
<i>Now time to explore some additional factors that may modify the consideration.  The main argument has been made and this is is basically appendix material.  Feel free to stop reading at this point, if you wish.</i>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>US Tax Law</h4>
This is an obvious factor to consider, but US law says that if you donate instead of invest, you can claim a deduction.  This deduction would appear annually, thus allowing you to donate additional money.  If you're earning the 50K I was talking about earlier, you'd be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States">taxed at effectively 16.9%</a>.  This would mean you could get back $845 on a $5K donation, assuming I understand tax law right.

If I donate $5K annually without investing, I'd actually be able to donate $409,150 over my seventy years rather than the original $350,000.  If I had invested and then donated it all, I'd get $3,741,715.14 instead of $3,200,782.84.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Changing Nature of Non-Profits</h4>
There's a good chance that if Giving What We Can stopped receiving donations, it would just collapse and then the opportunity to donate to it in seventy years would be gone (though I suppose it could be refounded with the new cash).  Additionally, GWWC couldn't learn from the seventy years of being able to operate, spend money, and try things.

And GWWC seems to be in a prime place right now to expand a lot and really grow it's outreach.  Thus it's at a critical time to fund when the marginal cost to recruit a new member is at probably some of the lowest it will be.  Now, not in seventy years, is a great time to get in.

Furthermore, I speculate that the marginal value will grow at a rate higher than the interest, such that $5K/year for seventy years would buy more members for GWWC than a flat $3.7 million in seventy years would.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>You Might Be Smarter In The Future</h4>
There's a good chance there might be better giving opportunities in seventy years, identified through our collective greater intelligence, your years of added experience, and the changing world (though <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/20/give-now-or-give-later/">GiveWell disagrees</a>, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/our-research/donating-vs-investing">as does GWWC</a>).  This could mean it is better to give later, because you could be donating to an overall higher impact opportunity.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>You Might Change Your Values</h4>
Some people are concerned that if they stored their donation money for seventy years, their future self might not care to donate it anymore.  Personally, the way I view my personal identity, I'd rather have done what my future self wanted me to do, so if my future self seventy years from now wished I would have been less altruistic, I want to be less altruistic now, so I don't see this as a concern.  But if you do, you should donate now, before your future self has a chance to redirect the money.

One way to protect from this might be to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor_advised_fund">donor advised fund</a>, which would also get the benefit of more charity deductions (since you can deduct each contribution to your fund) and your future wisdom while forcing your future self to donate.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Better Advocacy</h4>
It seems much easier to convince someone to give a little each year than to follow a solid savings plan -- as Scott Alexander states, there <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/05/investment-and-inefficient-charity/">are some strange psychological effects</a> that make us feel strongly like giving now and giving regularly is better, and we can secure the warm fuzzies feelings and social status of being considered a regular donor.

Moreover, if you convinced a friend to donate, you'd know much more immediately if they actually plan on sticking to it if you can see a donation they make in December rather than having to wait until they die.  (Though I suppose this too could be solved by having them contribute to your donor advised fund, if they trust you a lot.  But I imagine the average person wouldn't.)

Thus even if privately you should save, I think the best strategy to adopt publicly (when not speaking from an analytical point-of-view) is to encourage others to donate now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I start with the claim that it's good for people to eat less meat, whether they become vegetarian -- or, better yet, vegan -- because this means less nonhuman animals are being <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/whyvegan/animals.html">painfully factory farmed</a>.  I've defended this claim previously in <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-eat-less-meat/">"Why Eat Less Meat?"</a>.

The second idea is that it shouldn't matter <i>who</i> is eating less meat.  As long as less meat is being eaten, less animals will be farmed, and this is a good thing.  Therefore, we should try to get <i>other people</i> to also try and eat less meat.

The third idea is that it also doesn't matter <i>who</i> is doing the convincing.  Therefore, instead of convincing our own friends and family, we can pay other people to convince people to eat less meat.  And this is exactly what organizations like <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/">Vegan Outreach</a> and <a href="http://www.thehumaneleague.com/">The Humane League</a> are doing.  With a certain amount of money, one can hire someone to distribute pamphlets to other people or put advertisements on the internet, and some percentage of people who receive the pamphlets or see the ads will go on to eat less meat.

But the fourth idea is the complication.  I want my philanthropic dollars to go as far as possible, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">so as to help as much as possible</a>.  Therefore, it becomes very important to try and figure out how much money it takes to get people to eat less meat, so I can compare this to other estimations and see what gets me the best "bang for my buck".<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Other Estimations</h2>
I have seen other estimates floating around the internet that try to estimate the cost of distributing pamphlets, how many conversions each pamphlet produces, and how much less meat is ate via each conversion.  Brian Tomasik calculates <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/dollar-worth.pdf">$0.02 to $3.65 [PDF] per year of nonhuman animal suffering prevented</a>, later <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/veg-ads.html">$2.97 per year</a>, and then later <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/258113290967518/permalink/307655736013273/?comment_id=307773872668126&offset=0&total_comments=2">$0.55 to $3.65 per year</a>.

Jess Whittlestone <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/135-the-power-of-effective-activism">provides statistics that reveal an estimate of less than a penny per year</a>[1]. 

<a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org">Effective Animal Activism</a>, a non-profit evaluator for animal welfare charities, came <a href="http://effectiveanimalactivism.org/sites/effectiveanimalactivism.org/files/Animal%20Welfare.xlsx">up with an estimate [Excel Document]</a> of $0.04 to $16.60 per year of suffering averted, that also takes into account a variety of additional variables, like product elasticity.

Jeff Kaufman uses a different line of reasoning, by estimating how many vegetarians there are and guessing how many of them came via pamphlets, <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2011-11-10">estimates it would take $4.29 to $536</a> to make someone vegetarian for one year.  Extrapolating from that using at a rate of 255 animals saved per year and a weighted average of 329.6 days lived per animal (see below for justification of both assumptions), would give $0.02 to $1.90 per year of suffering averted[2].

A third line of reasoning, also by Jeff Kaufman, was to <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-04-17">measure the amount of comments</a> on the pro-vegetarian websites advertised in these campaigns and found that 2-22% of them were about an intended behavior change (eating less meat, going vegetarian, or going vegan), depending on the website.  I don't think we can draw any conclusions from this, but it's interesting.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>To make my calculations, I decided to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/">make a calculator</a>.</b>  Unfortunately, Wordpress doesn't allow it to be put here, so you'd have to open it in a new tab as a companion piece.

I'm going to start by using the following formula: <b>Years of Suffering Averted per Dollar = (Pamphlets / dollar) * (Conversions / pamphlet) * (Veg years / conversion) * (Animals saved / veg year) * (Days lived / animal)</b>

Now, to get estimations for these variables.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pamphlets Per Dollar</h2>
How much does it cost to place the advertisement, whether it be the paper pamphlet or a Facebook advertisement?  Nick Cooney, head of the Humane League, says the cost-per-click of Facebook ads is 20 cents.

But what about the cost per pamphlet?  This is more of a guess, but I'm going to go with <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/catalog/index.html">Vegan Outreach's suggested donation of $0.13 per "Compassionate choices" booklet</a>.

However, it's important to note that this cost must also include opportunity cost -- leafleters must forego the ability to use that time to work a job.  This means I must include an opportunity cost of say $8/hr on top of that, making the actual cost $0.27 assuming a pamphlet is given out each minute of volunteer time, meaning 3.7 people are reached per dollar from pamphlets.  For Facebook advertisements, the opportunity cost is trivial.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conversions Per Pamphlet</h2>
This is the estimate with the biggest target on it's head, so to speak.  How many people do we get to actually change their behavior with a simple pamphlet or Facebook advertisement?  Right now, we have three lines of evidence:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Facebook Study</h4>
Humane League did A $5000 Facebook advertisement campaign.  They bought ads that look like this...

<img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/voads.png" alt="voads" width="512" height="119" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-196" />

...and sent people to websites (like <a href="http://whosagainstanimalcruelty.org/">this one</a> or <a href="http://hiddenfaceoffood.com/">this one</a>) with auto-playing videos that start playing and show the horrors of factory farming.

Afterward, there was another advertisement run to people who "liked" the video page, offering a 1 in 10 chance of winning a free movie ticket in order to take a survey.  Everyone who emailed in asking for a free vegetarian starter kit were also emailed a survey.  104 people took the survey and there were 32 reported vegetarians[3] and 45 people reported, for example, that their chicken consumption decreased "slightly" or "significantly".

7% of visitors liked the page and 1.5% of visitors ordered a starter kit.  Assuming all the other people went away from the video not changing their consumption, this survey would lead us to (very tenuously) think about 2.6% of people seeing the video will become a vegetarian[4].

(<a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/FacebookAdsSurveyResults2011.pdf">Here's the results of the survey in PDF</a>.)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pamphlet Study</h4>
A second study discussed in <a href="http://ccc.farmsanctuary.org/the-powerful-impact-of-college-leafleting-part-1/">"The Powerful Impact of College Leafleting (Part 1)"</a> and <a href="http://ccc.farmsanctuary.org/the-powerful-impact-of-college-leafleting/">"The Powerful Impact of College Leafleting: Additional Findings and Details (Part 2)"</a> looked specifically at pamphlets.

Here, Humane League staff visited two large East Coast state schools and distributed leaflets.  They then returned two months later and surveyed people walking by.  Those who remember receiving a leaflet earlier were counted.  They found about 2% of those receiving a pamphlet went vegetarian.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vegetarian Years Per Conversion</h2>
But once a pamphlet or Facebook advertisement captures someone, how long will they stay vegetarian?  One survey <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22079892">showed vegetarians refrain from eating meat</a> for an average of 6 years or more.  Another <a href="http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2010issue4/2010_issue4_retention_survey.php">study I found</a> says 93% of vegetarians stay vegetarian for at least three years.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Animals Saved Per Vegetarian Year</h2>
And once you have a vegetarian, how many animals do they save per year?  CountingAnimals says <a href="http://countinganimals.com/how-many-animals-does-a-vegetarian-save/">406 animals saved per year</a>.  

The Humane League <a href="http://ccc.farmsanctuary.org/the-powerful-impact-of-college-leafleting/">suggests</a> 28 chickens, 2 egg industry hens, 1/8 beef cow, 1/2 pig, 1 turkey, and 1/30 dairy cow per year (total = 31.66 animals), and does not provide statistics on fish.  This agrees with CountingAnimals on non-fish totals.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Days Lived Per Animal</h2>
One problem, however, is that saving a cow that could suffer for years is different from saving a chicken that suffers for only about a month.  Using <a href="http://www.farmsanctuary.org/learn/factory-farming/dairy/#">data from Farm Sanctuary</a> plus World Society for the Protection of Animals <a href="http://www.ciwf.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2008/c/closed_waters_welfare_of_farmed_atlantic_salmon.pdf">data on fish</a> [PDF], I get this table:

<table>
<tr><td><b>Animal</b></td> <td><b>Number</b></td> <td><b>Days Alive</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Chicken (Meat)</td> <td>28</td> <td>42</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chicken (Egg)</td> <td>2</td> <td>365</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cow (Beef)</td> <td>0.125</td> <td>365</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cow (Milk)</td> <td>0.033</td> <td>1460</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fish</td> <td>225</td> <td>365</td></tr>
</table>

This makes the weighted average 329.6 days[5].

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
As I said before, our formula was <b>Years of Suffering Averted = (Pamphlets / dollar) * (Conversions / pamphlet) * (Veg years / conversion) * (Animals saved / veg year) * (Days lived / animal)</b>

Let's plug these values in...

<b>Years of Suffering Averted per Dollar = 5 * 0.02 * 3 * 255.16 * 329.6/365 = 69.12</b>

Or, assuming all this is right (and that's a big assumption), it would cost <b>less than 2 cents</b> to prevent a year of suffering on a factory farm by buying vegetarians.

I don't want to make it sound like I'm beholden to this cost estimate or that this estimate is the "end all, be all" of vegan outreach.  Indeed, I share many of the skepticisms that have been expressed by others.  Soon, I'll follow up this essay with another essay that accounts for various complications like reaching additional people, accounting for biases, and product elasticity, among other things.

The reason <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/">I made a calculator</a>, though, is so you can plug in your own values and be as pessimistic or optimistic as <i>you</i> think reasonable.

In a third and final essay, I'll also discuss methodological criticism to this approach.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[To repeat what we discussed <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/lesswrong/lw/hox/effective_altruism_through_advertising/959c" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>, the optimistic estimates here are claiming that vegan ads are much more effective than other behavior change ads for which much better studies have been done, e.g. randomized get out the vote interventions where voting numbers are public records, uncontaminated by desirability bias (which is treated dubiously here). Regressing towards that prior in our predictions of the true effect would dramatically cut these estimates.

Also, if we weight the different farmed animals by number of neurons, relative cost-effectiveness in buying neuron-years falls by 400-1000+ times relative to similar effects in humans (or, rather, the value of life-years for humans is so multiplied relative to the mix discussed in the post), since the figures are dominated by the farmed animals with the tiniest and simplest nervous systems.

See  and <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/experience.pdf" rel="nofollow">Bostrom</a>'s paper on quantity of experience and the research on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain" rel="nofollow">split-brain patients</a> for a start on the case for hedonistic utilitarians to weight by neuron count (as an imperfect proxy for quantity of pleasure or pain, separately from its quality/magnitude).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with Carl that there may be some weighting that can be done based on neuron count. However, this must be done with an extreme level of caution for several reasons.

One reason to be cautious is that humans have a significant amount of brain mass that is NOT important in moral considerations. It would seem likely that many animals would have a smaller proportion of such brain mass, particularly as total brain size decreases.

Another, perhaps more significant, consideration is that as brain size decreases, brains may develop <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_dickinson_how_a_fly_flies.html" rel="nofollow">more "advanced" methods of processing</a>. (In the link, he starts talking about brain physiology at about 8:40)

So, it seems as though we have enough information to know that it is much more complicated than just neuron count. I would not argue that this means we cannot weight by such metrics, just that we would need to reevaluate the numbers, calculate an expected margin of error, and weight according to that margin.]]></wp:comment_content>

A much simpler and easier  and cheaper way is just for all Vegetarians,Vegans and people who respect animals to inform and educate the people they come into contact with. Not by pushing their view down their throat, but by example and gently persuasion to do what is right for the whole planet. The ripple when a stone falls into a pond theory, it all depends on how big the pond is !! Simplistic but effective. The Animal welfare associations are very good, but you need constant contact for it to work well, and that is where the money is wasted. People give money today, then it is all forgotten, until they see another, paid for, advert! Word of mouth and example work for me best!!]]></wp:comment_content>

				<title>Why Eat Less Meat?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the past two years, the only place I ate meat was at home with my family.  As of October 2012, I've finally stopped eating meat altogether and can't see a reason why I would want to go back to eating meat.  This kind of attitude toward eating is commonly classified as "vegetarianism" where one refrains from eating the flesh of all animals, including fish, but still will consume animal products like eggs and milk (though I try to avoid egg as best I can).

Why might I want to do this?  And why might I see it as a serious issue?  It's because I'm very concerned about the reality of suffering done to our "food animals" in the process of making them into meat, because I see vegetarianism as a way to reduce this suffering by stopping the harmful process, and because vegetarianism has not been hard at all for me to accomplish.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Animals Can Suffer</h2>
Back in the 1600s, Réné Descartes thought nonhuman animals were soulless automatons that could respond to their environment and react to stimuli, but could not feel anything — humans were the only species that were truly conscious. Descartes hit on an important point — since feelings are completely internal to the animal doing the feeling, it is impossible to demonstrate that anyone is truly conscious.

However, when it comes to humans, we don’t let that stop us from assuming other people feel pain. When we jab a person with a needle, no matter who they are, where they come from, or what they look like, they share a rather universal reaction of what we consider to be evidence of pain. We also extend this to our pets — we make great strides to avoid harming kittens, puppies, or other companion animals, and no one would want to kick a puppy or light a kitten on fire just because their consciousness cannot be directly observed. That’s why we even go as far as having laws against animal cruelty.

The animals we eat are no different. Pigs, chickens, cows, and fish all have incredibly analogous responses to stimuli that we would normally agree cause pain to humans and pets.  Jab a pig with a needle, kick a chicken, or light a cow on fire, and they will react aversively like any cat, dog, horse, or human.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Science</h4>
But we don't need to rely on just our intuition -- instead, we can look at the science.  <a href="http://www.grandin.com/welfare/fear.pain.stress.html">Animal scientists Temple Grandin and Mark Deesing</a> conclude that "[o]ur review of the literature on frontal cortex development enables us to conclude that all mammals, including rats, have a sufficiently developed prefrontal cortex to suffer from pain".  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLSwRcvX72M">An interview of seven different scientists</a> concludes that animals can suffer.

Dr. Jane Goodall, famous for having studied animals, writes in her introduction to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inner-World-Farm-Animals-Intellectual/dp/1584797487"><b>The Inner World of Farm Animals</b></a> that "farm animals feel pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear, and pain. They are far more aware and intelligent than we ever imagined…they are individuals in their own right."  Farm Sanctuary, an animal welfare organization, <a href="http://www.farmsanctuary.org/learn/someone-not-something/">has a good overview documenting this research on animal emotion</a>.

Lastly, among much other evidence, in the <a href="http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf">"Cambridge Declaration On Consciousness"</a>, prominent international group of cognitive  neuroscientists, neuropharmacologists, neurophysiologists, neuroanatomists and computational neuroscientists states:

<blockquote>Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors.  Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Nonhuman animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also  possess these neurological substrates.</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Factory Farming Causes Considerable Suffering</h2>
However, the fact that animals can suffer is just one piece of the picture; we next have to establish that animals <i>do</i> suffer as a result of people eating meat.  Honestly, this is easier shown than told -- there's <a href="http://whosagainstanimalcruelty.org/">an extremely harrowing and shocking 11-minute video about the cruelty available</a>.  Watching that video is perhaps the easiest way to see the suffering of nonhuman animals first hand in these "factory farms".

In making the case clear, <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/whyvegan/animals.html">Vegan Outreach writes</a> "Many people believe that animals raised for food must be treated well because sick or dead animals would be of no use to agribusiness. This is not true."

They then go on to document, with sources, how virtually all birds raised for food are from factory farms where "resulting ammonia levels [from densely populated sheds and accumulated waste] commonly cause painful burns to the birds' skin, eyes, and respiratory tracts" and how hens "become immobilized and die of asphyxiation or dehydration", having been "[p]acked in cages (usually less than half a square foot of floor space per bird)".  In fact, <a href="http://countinganimals.com/is-vegan-outreach-right-about-how-many-animals-suffer-to-death/">137 million chickens suffer to death each year</a> before they can even make it to slaughter -- more than the number of animals killed for fur, in shelters and in laboratories combined!

Farm Sanctuary also <a href="http://www.farmsanctuary.org/learn/factory-farming/">provides an excellent overview of the cruelty of factory farming</a>, writing "Animals on factory farms are regarded as commodities to be exploited for profit. They undergo painful mutilations and are bred to grow unnaturally fast and large for the purpose of maximizing meat, egg, and milk production for the food industry."

<b>It seems clear that factory farming practices are truly deplorable, and certainly are not worth the benefit of eating a slightly tastier meal.</b>  In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/10/magazine/10ANIMAL.html?pagewanted=all">"An Animal's Place"</a>, Michael Pollan writes:
<blockquote>To visit a modern CAFO (Confined Animal Feeding Operation) is to enter a world that, for all its technological sophistication, is still designed according to Cartesian principles: animals are machines incapable of feeling pain. Since no thinking person can possibly believe this any more, industrial animal agriculture depends on a suspension of disbelief on the part of the people who operate it and a willingness to avert your eyes on the part of everyone else.</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vegetarianism Can Make a Difference</h2>
Many people see the staggering amount of suffering in factory farms, and if they don't aim to dismiss it outright will say that there's no way they can make a difference by changing their eating habits.  However, this is certainly not the case!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How Many Would Be Saved?</h4>
Drawing from the 2010 <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1097">Livestock Slaughter Animal Summary</a> and the <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1497">Poultry Slaughter Animal Summary</a>, 9.1 billion land animals are either grown in the US or imported (94% of which are chickens!), 1.6 billion are exported, and 631 million die before anyone can eat them, leaving 8.1 billion land animals for US consumption <b>each year</b>.

A naïve average would divide this total among the population of the US, which is 311 million, assigning 26 land animals for each person's annual consumption.  Thus, by being vegetarian, you are saving 26 land animals a year you would have otherwise eaten.  And this doesn't even count fish, which could be quite high given how many fish need to be grown just to be fed to bigger fish!

Yet, this is not quite true.  It's important to note that supply and demand aren't perfectly linear.  If you reduce your demand for meat, the suppliers will react by lowering the price of meat a little bit, making it so more people can buy it.  Since chickens dominate the meat market, we'll adjust by the supply elasticity of chickens, <a href="http://www.rti.org/pubs/poultry_slaughter.pdf">which is 0.22</a> and the demand elasticity of chickens, <a href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/31190/1/23020558.pdf">which is -0.52</a>, and calculate the change in supply, which is 0.3.  Taking this multiplier, it's more accurate to say <b>you're saving 7.8 land animals a year or more</b>.  Though, there are a lot of complex considerations in calculating elasticity, so we should take this figure to have some uncertainty.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Collective Action</h4>
One might critique this response by responding that since meat is often bought in bulk, reducing meat consumption won't affect the amount of meat bought, and thus the suffering will still be the same, except with meat gone to waste.  However, this ignores the effect of many different vegetarians acting together.

Imagine that you're supermarket buys cases of 200 chicken wings.  It would thus take 200 people together to agree to buy 1 less wing in order for the supermarket to buy less wings.  However, you have no idea if you're vegetarian #1 or vegetarian #56 or vegetarian #200, making the tipping point for 200 less wings to be bought.  You thus can estimate that by buying one less wing you have a 1 in 200 chance of reducing 200 wings, which is equivalent to reducing the supply by one wing.  So the effect basically cancels out.  See <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/thresholds.pdf">here</a> or <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/vegetarianism.html">here</a> for more.

Every time you buy factory farmed meat, you are creating demand for that product, essentially saying "Thank you, I liked what you are doing and want to encourage you to do it more".  By eating less meat, we can stop our support of this industry.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vegetarianism Is Easier Than You Think</h2>
So nonhuman animals can suffer and do suffer in factory farms, and we can help stop this suffering by eating less meat.  I know people who get this far, but then stop and say that, as much as they would like to, there's no way they could be a vegetarian because they like meat too much!  However, such a joy for meat shouldn't count much compared to the massive suffering each animal undergoes just to be farmed -- imagine if someone wouldn't stop eating your pet just because they like eating your pet so much!

This is less than a problem than you might think, because being a vegetarian is really easy.  Most people only think about what they would have to give up and how good it tastes, and don't think about what tasty things they could eat instead that have no meat in them.  When I first decided to be a vegetarian, I simply switched from tasty hamburgers to href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/guide/substitutes.html">tasty veggieburgers</a> and there was no problem at all.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A Challenge</h4>
To those who say that vegetarianism is too hard, I’d like to simply challenge you to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/5a5/no_seriously_just_try_it/">just try it</a> for a few days. Feel free to give up afterward if you find it too hard. But I imagine that you should do just fine, find great replacements, and be able to save animals from suffering in the process.

If reducing suffering is one of your goals, there’s no reason why you must either be a die-hard meat eater or a die-hard vegetarian. Instead, feel free to explore some middle ground. You could be a vegetarian on weekdays but eat meat on weekends, or just try Meatless Mondays, or simply try to eat less meat. You could try to eat bigger animals like cows instead of fish or chicken, thus <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html">getting the same amount of meat with significantly less suffering</a>.

				<title>In Giving, It Pays to Precommit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In Homer’s <u>Odyssey</u>, Odysseus’s crew sailed past the island of the Sirens. In Greek lore, the Sirens were notorious for singing a song so enchanting that those who listened would sail toward the Sirens and end up crashing into the rocks, sealing their own fate.

The common solution of the era was to avoid listening to the song altogether – plugging one’s ears with beeswax. But Odysseus wanted to listen to the song... though, of course, he didn’t want to end up crashing his ship and killing his crew.

Thus, not trusting his future willpower, Odysseus had his crew tie him to the mast of the ship and precommitted to not be let go. Predictably, when he heard the song he begged to be released, but his crew followed his earlier orders and didn’t let him go. Odysseus survived on the basis of precommitment<sup>1</sup>.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why Precommitment?</h2>
The motivation for precommitment stems from a problem in human nature: there are some goals we find desirable (to know how to dance competently, to have good grades, to be fit and healthy, etc.) but still struggle to do certain activities that would accomplish these goals (take dance lessons, study hard for the upcoming test, exercise and eat right, etc.).

People are frequently averse to taking on short-term costs even if they would achieve long-term gains.<sup>2</sup> People value their current time much more than the future (called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting">hyperbolic discounting</a>),<sup>3,4</sup> struggle with low expectancy of success, struggle with the drudgery of actually performing the task, and are occasionally impulsive and forgetful with their tasks<sup>5,6</sup>.

Such failures to do what we want and act against our considered judgments are commonly called <i>akrasia</i>, or “weakness of will”, a term first coined by Aristotle more than two thousand years ago<i>.</i> Odysseus recognized that he wouldn’t have enough willpower to resit the Siren’s song, so he took steps to ensure he would end up acting the way he wanted. He used precommitment to increase his willpower.

In our own lives, we face problems where we really want to do something, but face issues with our own willpower and procrostination. In looking for a solution, we can be like Odysseus... except without our lives having to be on the line. Precommitment is helpful at reducing the impulsiveness which drives procrastination and other forms of <i>akrasia</i>.<sup>7</sup> While we don’t have to get tied to a mast, the idea is the same – one takes an earlier and easier action now (paying for a gym membership, promising a friend, or getting tied to a pole) that makes it much easier to perform the harder yet still  desirable action later on.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Pledge to Give</h2>
Many of us think giving to charity is personally desirable. People frequently pay more for products when they’re linked to charity.<sup>7</sup> The act of giving also enriches people’s lives and make them lastingly happier.<sup>9,10,11</sup> However, impulsiveness means <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/30/last-minute-donations/">many donations are made last minute</a>, people forgetting to donate despite wanting to, and people pursuing giving in a haphazard and unstructured way. Just like it’s hard to eat right and exercise right, it seems hard to donate right as well.

At the organization Giving What We Can, members <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/our-pledge">take a public pledge</a> to donate at least 10% of their income to whichever organization they sincerely believe will do the most to help alleviate extreme poverty in the developing world. Such a pledge represents a precommitment to donate future earnings. But does it actually help people donate more than they otherwise would?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Does Precommitment Work?</h2>
In one study, smokers who wanted to quit were offered a savings account in which they deposited a considerable amount of funds for six months. After the sixth month period, the smokers are tested for nicotine via a urine test. If they are clean, they get back all the money in their savings account. If not, all the money is forfeited to charity. 11% of the smokers randomly offered the program took it on – about the same rate as those that accept other smoking treatments. Of those who accepted the program, 33% were able to quit smoking, which is 3% better than other top quitting programs.

More importantly, those who were smoke-free at the end of the program were also smoke-free at a surprise follow up test six months after the first study, a year after the people had signed-up. It seems precommitment had been able to produce lasting change in a way that financial incentives and nicotine replacements were not able to do so, against all the forces of habit and addiction that make people struggle with smoking.<sup>12</sup>

Along the same lines, despite the examples of people who buy a gym membership but then never use it, an examination does suggest that precommiting to the gym membership by paying for it in advance makes one more likely to go to the gym than those who express a desire but don’t get a membership. This also wasn’t just because those who would be willing to pay upfront had a stronger desire to go to the gym, because those who renewed their precommitment monthly were much more likely than those who committed for a year.<sup>13</sup>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Does Precommitment Work <i>for Charity</i>?</h2>
Precommitment doesn’t just have to be for those who want to quit smoking or for those who want to exercise more. Indeed, precommitment can work for those who recognize they can donate a portion of their income and have a significant benefit in the world, yet have trouble getting around to actually donating.

In another experiment, monthly donors were randomly asked to either increase their donation immediately or precommit to increasing their donation in two months, not being told of the experiment. Those who were asked to precommit ended up increasing their donations on average 32% more than those who were asked immediately and a year later cancellation rates were statistically identical in both groups.<sup>14</sup> Such results were duplicated when people were asked to precommit both imaginary and real raffle winnings in separate experiments.<sup>15</sup>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why Does Precommitment Work?</h2>
Precommitment works well when you deliberately set things up so you cannot back out easily (backing out would be very expensive or downright impossible), but it also works even when the punishment for backing out is light. For example, backing out of a Giving What We Can pledge risks just the potential disappointment of a few people you don’t know on a personal level, or looking weird for having gone back on a public statement. So how is precommitment so powerful?

Neuroscience studies reveal that people give to charity for two primary reasons – pure altruism, or a desire to genuinely help other people, and the “warm glow” of self-satisfaction.<sup>9,14</sup> For many people, donating creates a tension because the pure altruism payoff is not realized for awhile, but one faces the prospect of parting with money immediately. By introducing a delay via precommitment, the self-satisfaction is realized immediately at the precommitment, but the monetary cost (the actual donation) can be viewed with psychological distance, making one think more rationally and less impulsively about what the money can do.<sup>3,4,5,14</sup>

Thus precommitments help by getting the benefits upfront without having to immediately face the costs, which shifts the nature of the choice to one we can do now and face the consequences later, which comes more naturally to ourselves when making choices.<sup>2,3,4,5,14</sup>

Additionally, precommitments create a cost of backing out which, when compared with the minimal cost of complying with the precommimtent, seems not worth it. Thus precommiments can almost be considered “inverse procrastionation”, since they flip the scenario on us and make us procrastinate on undoing our precommitment, even if we feel inclined to.<sup>14</sup>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Precommitments work to reliably motivate yourself to solve problems of impulsiveness and “weakness of will”, helping you do something you would not have otherwise been able to do. It’s a weird quirk of our psychology that we have to deal with <i>akrasia</i> and have to “trick” ourselves into doing something we really, in the end, want to do all along. It mainly comes from our nature, for right or for wrong, as impulsive hyperbolic discounters – of valuing the immediate present much more than the future.

Precommitment is rooted in inversing the impulsiveness and getting it to work for you, by setting up an immediate cost for not performing the long-term action. Furthermore, precommitment allows one to gain the benefits of self-satisfaction without having to immediately face any costs. Lastly, precommitments help create the psychological distance needed to get over more automatic and immediate feelings.

Donating is one of these actions that is hard to do, especially in a structured way. But by making a public commitment to it that creates some social cost to you for backing out, it becomes a lot easier to keep up the habit. As most GivingWhatWeCan members can attest, skimming off the 10% of income to a top charity is not only second-nature, but fun. And all it took was a little precommitment.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the fourth edition of Sunday Links!  In this edition, I'm going to focus on the exploration of "earning to give".  You know how some people talk about "doing well by doing good"?  Well "earning to give" is basically "doing good by doing well" -- you look specifically for a high paying job in order to earn a lot of money, and then use your large disposable income to donate to charity.

For instance, one might think to join a non-profit and do important work and earn a salary of $30K.  Or, one might instead choose to become a banker or stock trader, earn $100K+, keep the same salary of $30K, and and donate the $70K+ and hire <i>two or more</i> charity workers to serve in their place.  Chances are good that those two charity workers who displace you will do more good combined than you will have done if you worked in their place, and that you displaced someone who would have joined finance but not donated their money.

As Jeff Kaufman <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-03-11">considers summarizing it</a>, the idea is to "[g]ive money to the most effective charities, and maximize your impact by earning more and spending less."  A basic introduction of this idea can be found in the <a href="http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give">80000 Hours topic</a> and <a href="http://80000hours.org/faq#faq-what-is-earning-to-give">corresponding FAQ</a>.  Brian Tomasik also has a pretty thorough summary of the idea in <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html">"Why Activists Should Consider Making Lots of Money"</a>.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Popular Press, Objections, and Rebuttals</h2>
This idea has taken to popular press over the years, with <a href="http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2011/11/banking-as-an-ethical-career/">an article on Practical Ethics</a>, <a href="http://qz.com/57254/to-save-the-world-dont-get-a-job-at-a-charity-go-work-on-wall-street/">Quartz</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15820786">BBC</a>, and recently <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/?tid=ts_carousel">The Washington Post</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2334682/Young-professionals-joining-Wall-Street-save-world.html">Daily Mail</a>.

The Washington Post article in particular prompted people to write in some criticism, including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?_r=1&">a column from David Brooks</a>.  Brooks argues that (1) you risk losing your motivation and (2) you risk not living a sufficiently "full" life.  Alexander Berger <a href="http://marginalchange.blogspot.ca/2013/06/2013-david-brooks-vs-2011-david-brooks.html">responds</a>, pointing out that burnout is a risk, but the motivations of those people earning to give are definitely there and that they are living "full" lives.

A <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/349841/rise-singerians-reihan-salam">objection in the National Review</a> that suggests "earning to give" favors individual action and ignores the good that can come from public action.  This is <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage">responded to by 80,000 Hours</a>, which says it's a political point being read that doesn't actually exist.

Ben Kuhn <a href="http://www.benkuhn.net/etg-objections">looks at more objections</a> that surfaced in the comments sections of various articles, and he finds that people object to (1) some "earning to give" careers (like banking) doing bad by promoting negative capitalist systems, (2) that where "earning to give" people are giving (mostly the <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com">Against Malaria Foundation</a> ignores focusing on "root causes" in favor of addressing symptoms, and (3) general objections to utilitarianism.  Kuhn addresses those arguments in that article.

Jeff Kaufman also looks at objections to banking as a career and <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-06-03">proposes we talk about other careers instead</a>, like computer programming, teacher, or social worker.  Julia Wise writes about <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/whats-it-like-to-give-half.html">how she could still "earn to give" on a $38K salary</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>But is "Earning to Give" Actually a Good Idea?</h2>
So all this is great, and I'm glad there's a big conversation now on effectiveness and considering career choice as an ethical question.  However, while the level of criticism I've seen in the popular press isn't great, there definitely are objections to "earning to give" that matter.

<b>First, I think the issue of burnout is considered by those who think about "earning to give", but never directly addressed.</b>  How many people pursuing "earning to give" end up burning out?   And what happens then?  Can one really choose <i>any</i> high-earning career and do well at it, or does one also need some sort of direct passion for the job?

<b>Second, can't there be more beneficial careers than "earning to give"?</b> Generally, I agree with <a href="<a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage">80,000 Hours's response</a> and <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-03-02">Jeff Kaufman's consideration</a> that "earning to give" is a <i>baseline</i>, not the best option.  It's a useful and powerful point of comparison to ask "Is what I'm doing better than just earning a higher salary and donating it?".

Frequently, however, I think this baseline can be beaten.  While there's a "make more money to donate" side of things, there's also a "make the donated money work better" side, working in the organizations themselves to increase the impact of each donation by increasing the impact of the organizations themselves.  As Jeff Kaufman records in <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-05-20">"Talent or Money"</a>, some organizations like <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> probably would benefit more from additional talent than additional money.  In <a href="http://www.effective-altruism.com/node/31">"Earning to Give vs. Altruistic Career Choice Revisited"</a>, Jonah Sinick discusses that consideration among a few others.

Overall, the career you choose is an incredibly important choice to consider not just from a personal perspective, but from an ethical perspective.  But it's also a very individual choice and the good one can do with their career and the satisfaction they can get out of it depend immensely on one's individual talents and desires.  Therefore, a would-be career do-gooder should instead try to find individualized advice (such as that offered by <a href="http://www.80000hours.org">80000 Hours</a>) and consider a wider variety of careers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Continuation of <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">How Much Does It Cost to Buy a Vegetarian</a></b>

Recently, I've been trying to figure out how much it costs to save animals from factory farming.  The idea is to get people to become vegetarian by funding advertisements to influence them.  In <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">the previous essay</a>, I used a simple formula to work out the cost and it turned out to be a really cheap $0.02 to prevent a year of animal suffering on a factory farm (about $10 to get someone to become vegetarian for a year).

I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/">built a calculator</a> so that anyone can play around with the formulas and be as pessimistic or optimistic as they like and see how that effects the calculations.

However, the simple calculation is... well... <i>simple</i>, and it needs some "beefing up", no pun intended.  Therefore, I also built a "complex calculator" that works on a much more complex formula[1] that is hopefully correct[2] and will provide a more accurate estimation.  Here are the details...<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Accounting For Biases</h2>
The big, big deal for the surveys is concern for bias.  The most frequently mentioned bias is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_desirability_bias">social desirability bias</a>, or people who say they reduced meat just because they want to please the surveyor or look like a good person, which actually happens a lot more on surveys than we'd like.

To account for this, we'll have to figure out how inflated answers are because of this bias and then scale the answers down by that amount.  Nick Cooney who says that he's been reading studies that about 25% to 50% of people who say they are vegetarian actually are, though I don't yet have the citations.  Thus, if we find out that an advertisement creates two meat reducers, we'd scale that down to one reducer if we're expecting a 50% desirability bias.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The second bias that will be a problem for us is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-response_bias">non-response bias</a>, as those who don't reduce their diet are less likely to take the survey and therefore less likely to be counted.  This is especially true in the Facebook study, which only measures people who "liked" or requested a starter kit, showing some pro-vegetarian affiliation.

We can balance this out by assuming everyone who didn't take the survey went on to have no behavior change whatsoever.  <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/FacebookAdsSurveyResults2011.pdf">Nick Cooney's Facebook Ad Survey</a> is for the 7% of people who liked the page (and then responded to the survey), and obviously those who liked the page are more likely to reduce their consumption.  I chose an optimistic value of 90% to consider the survey completely representative of the 7% who liked the page, and then a bit more for those who reduced their consumption but did not like the page.  My pessimistic value was 95%, assuming everyone who did not like the survey went unchanged and assuming a small response bias among those who liked the page but chose not to take the survey.

For the pamphlets, however, there should be no response bias since the entire population of college students was surveyed from randomly, and no one was said to reject taking the survey.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Additional People Are Being Reached</h2>
In the Facebook survey, those who said they reduced their meat consumption were also asked if they influenced any of their friends and family to also reduce eating meat, and found that they usually produced 0.86 additional reducers.

This figure seems very high, but I do strongly expect the figure to be positive -- people who reduce eating meat will talk about it sometimes, essentially becoming free advertisements.  I'd be very surprised if they ended up being a net negative.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Accounting for Product Elasticity</h2>
Another way to boost the effectiveness of the estimate is to be more accurate about what happens when someone stops eating meat.  The change isn't from the actual refusal to eat, but rather from the reduced demand for meat, which leads to a reduced supply.  Following the laws of economics, however, this reduction won't necessarially be one-for-one, but rather depend on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(economics)">elasticity of product demand and supply</a>.  By getting this number, we can find out how much meat is reduced for every meat not demanded.

My guesses in the calculator come from the following sources, some of which are PDFs: <a href="http://www.agecon.ksu.edu/livestock/Extension%20Bulletins/BeefDemandDeterminants.pdf">1</a>, <a href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/21679/1/sp99ma02.pdf">2</a>, <a href="http://www.thepigsite.com/swinenews/21164/market-preview-understanding-pork-demand">3</a>, <a href="http://www.poultryscience.org/docs/PS_822.pdf">4</a>, <a href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/31190/1/23020558.pdf">5</a>, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9781119993384">6</a>, <a href="http://dare.colostate.edu/skoontz/arec510/papers/marsh%20%28ajae%201994%29.pdf">7</a>, <a href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/14745/1/wp9808.pdf">8</a>, <a href="http://www.rti.org/pubs/muth_pork-slaughter_final.pdf">9</a>, <a href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/31510/1/27010043.pdf">10</a>, <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/dept/IIFET/Japan/proceedupdates/306.pdf">11</a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Putting It All Together, Redux</h2>
Implementing the formula <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/">on the calculator</a>, we end up with an estimate of <b>$0.03 to $36.52</b> to reduce one year of suffering on a factory farm based on the Facebook ad data and an estimate of <b>$0.02 to $65.92</b> based on the pamphlet data.

Hopefully the complexities in this calculator address some of the criticism for this approach.  In the third and final part of this essay series, I'll discuss the criticism in depth, and highlight what I agree and disagree with.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/category/resolutions/">New Years Resolutions</a> have been greatly boosting my day-to-day behaviors so that I become the kind of person that has good diet, good fitness, and good productivity.  However, I've decided that I want to not just focus on my day-to-day, but my behaviors from "30,000 feet" or "year-to-year", so to speak.  I want to set goals and be more strategic.

This is the essay where I do some goal setting for the next year.  Right now, I think I'll commit to revising this plan every six months (November and May), but I reserve the right to change that.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Making The World a Better Place</h2>
Given that you're on a site called "Everyday Utilitarian", you could imagine that there will be a lot of discussion about how to maximize utility and make the world a better place.  Continuing allegiance to utilitarian ideals, I want to focus the majority of my efforts on making the world a better place.  But I'm having trouble getting a bit more specific than that.  When asked, I always say "right now, my long term goals are to figure out what my long term goals are."

However, upon further reflection, I can currently categorize what I plan on doing to make the world a better place into three groups -- thinking, blogging, and volunteering.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Thinking Through Complex Issues</h4>
I've already thought a lot, but I've basically learned that things are more complex than I thought, and I need to do even more thinking.  Here are some questions I intend to focus on:

<ul>
<p><li><b>What normative framework should I choose?</b> How does one even choose a normative framework?  I've been working on normativity since 2010 and have undergone four drafts of various theory back on my old blog.  I think my most recent theory seems very promising, but it needs some clarification, re-updating, and re-presenting.</li></p>
<p><li><b>How, if at all, can utilitarianism be presented as a robust moral theory?</b> Many of the other candidates for morality (deontology, virtue ethics, divine command theory, etc.) don't even pretend to be robust.  But utilitarianism needs to be presented as either (1) a moral theory that can fully account for all scenarios without inconsistency or (2) presented with an "impossibility theorem" that demonstrates that consistency is impossible.</li></p>
<p><li><b>What would someone acting out utilitarianism in their everyday life look like?</b>  Focusing on this would involve focusing a lot on presenting utilitarianism in a way that matches "common sense".</li></p>
<p><li><b>What causes should a utilitarian focus on?</b>  Right now, people seem to have settled on focusing either on the developing world, nonhuman animal suffering in factory farms, nonhuman animal suffering in the wild, or existential risk reduction.  Why focus on any one of those causes over the others?  Are there other causes that are being overlooked?  Are all of these causes worthwhile?  This will take personal investigation.</li></p>
<p><li><b>What should I do when I graduate?</b> I will be graduating Denison University in 2014 and I'll need a "Career Plan for After Graduation<sup>TM</sup>".  <a href="http://80000hours.org/">80000 Hours</a> has taught me the importance of my working hours and I aim to use them to do something good, though I haven't really decided <i>what</i> yet. (See <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-plan/">"My Careers Plan"</a> for my initial thoughts.)</li></p>
<p><li><b>How, if at all, should I change my lifestyle?</b> I've been working on my <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/category/resolutions/">New Years Resolutions</a> plan, but there are definitely other tweaks I need to do to be healthier and more productive.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Blogging</h4>
Not by coincidence, the questions I need to think a lot about are the focus of this blog, hence <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-i-blog/">why I blog</a>.  Blogging helps clear my mind, let me revisit old ideas, and let me organize information on these questions.  But perhaps more importantly, blogging stands to be a social good for people who are also looking on answering these questions, because they could benefit from my work.  In turn, they can build upon my work and comment back, thus allowing me to benefit from what they're doing.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Volunteering for Like-Minded Communities</h4>
The third part of my trio is to spend time working for the benefit of like-minded communities.  This is because these communities come together and think about the big issues I discussed earlier, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/for-impact-the-future-matters-more/">thereby allowing me to use my effort to make future efforts go by easier</a>.  If done right, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/giving-now-currently-seems-to-beat-giving-later/">this could have a compounding effect</a> that could realize immense benefits.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Making Denison University a Better Place</h2>
I must admit though that I don't plan to be 100% focused on making the world a better place.  First, I plan on having some free time to just hang out with my family, friends, or watch TV all by myself.  However, I also plan on spending some of my last year at Denison working on improving my <i>local</i> community.

Why?  Mostly for it's own sake -- I like my local community and also want it to succeed.  Also, I started some projects before becoming focused on the world as a whole, and I want to see them come to fruition.  However, I also think my activities will have indirect benefits on my more global-oriented activities, since (1) they'll boost my résumé and (2) it will give me "sandbox"-like practice.  I've found it's easier to practice finding optimal strategies when you confine your work to about 2000 people.

At Denison, I'm going to focus on the following six extracurricular activities:

<ul>
<p><li><b>Venture Philanthropy Club:</b> VPC is <a href="http://www.denison.edu/campuslife/servicelearning/venture_philanthropy_club.html">a grant-making college organization</a> that gives a $10K grant out each year and then volunteers to implement that grant.  It's basically a microcosm of effective altruism because, while we limit our scope to Licking County, Ohio, we focus on being as effective as we can within those limitations.  I do some direct good for the local community, get experience with organizations, and encourage effectiveness.</p></li>

<p><li><b>Denison Community Association:</b> The DCA is <a href="http://www.denison.edu/campuslife/servicelearning/denison_community_associatio.html">the umbrella organization for all volunteering on campus</a>.  I will be coordinating all the work of various volunteering groups (including VPC) to help them be more unified and to share strengths from some organizations to others.  This will give me more experience with management and coordination as well as boost Denison's capacity to volunteer.</p></li>

<p><li><b>Beta Theta Pi:</b> I will be the Recruitment Chair of our chapter in <a href="http://betathetapi.org/">my fraternity</a>.  This will give me experience in another management role.  I don't see it as doing much utilitarian-oriented direct good, but it will be fun.</p></li>

<p><li><b>Moot Court:</b>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moot_court">Moot court</a> is simulated Supreme Court argument.  This also doesn't have any utilitarian-oriented direct good, but it greatly strengthens my communication skills, which is good in general, and my knowledge of the law, which would be good if I wanted to go to law school.</p></li>

<p><li><b>Gaming Guild:</b>  I used to be President of our local Gaming Guild.  I intend to keep up with this as it's a great way to have fun with friends and I want to make sure my legacy as President doesn't fall apart.</p></li>

<p><li><b>Research:</b> I will be doing more research in Political Science and Psychology.  I don't know if the research itself will be valuable in it's own right (I suspect not), but it will improve my strength as a researcher and could benefit me greatly if I choose to go to graduate school.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Changes I'm Making</h2>
Based on this, I'm going to make a few concrete changes to how I plan on spending my time for the next several months.

<ul>
<p><li><b>Emphasize more thinking, blogging, and volunteering.</b>  I want to be more focused on pursuing utilitarian-oriented good, so I'm going to be spending more time on my blog thinking through the aforementioned big problems.  I also will spend more time providing content and/or administration to <a href="http://felicifia.org/">Felicifia</a>, <a href="http://lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a>, <a href="reddit.com/r/smartgiving">r/smartgiving</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/">Effective Altruism Facebook Group</a>, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>, <a href="http://www.80000hours.org">80K Hours</a>, and <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.com">Effective Animal Activism</a>.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Emphasize finding and talking to more cool people.</b>  Whether it be Skype conversations, email, Facebook chats, or comments sections, I want to spend more time in dialogue around important issues with cool people that can help me think through things.  I haven't been quite as intentional about this as I have wanted to be in the past.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Emphasize more "targeted reading".</b>  Previously, my time spent reading was aimless but still fruitful.  I want to decrease the amount of time spent being aimless though, while keeping the fruitful part.  I will then shift more time to reading specific books and sites I think will help me answer these questions and come back and actually blog about them, both parts I've had trouble with.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Continue New Years Resolutions program.</b>  It's been very successful and I need to continue it to keep up with all the great habits it's been creating.  I've been able to get myself to exercise, eat right, lose weight, be more productive, and more.  This is amazing and I want to keep it up.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Continue to not lose sight of important relationships.</b>  I think I've been good at not getting totally sucked into a pro-utilitarian black hole, and I'd like to keep that up too by continuing to make time for friends and family.</li></p>

<p><li><b>De-emphasize Gaming Guild.</b>  One can easily end up spending a lot of time at Gaming Guild activities.  At my high point, I spent about 18 hours a week doing Gaming Guild stuff, which is crazy!  It seems more reasonable to bring that number down to the 7-9 range, if even that much.  I just need to spread out that time to other activities.</li></p>

<p><li><b>De-emphasize looking for a campus job.</b>  I used to obsess over finding a campus job so I could earn some income to spend, save, and donate.  But it might be better in the long-run if I just spend that time doing other things instead.  What I'm doing is, by my personal estimate, worth more than $8.30 an hour and I have enough money to get by through senior year.</li></p>
</ul>

				<title>My Careers Plan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I mentioned in <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-strategic-plan">my strategic plan</a>, <b>I have 10 months and 29 days until I graduate</b> from Denison University and hopefully will be transitioning to a <i>career</i>.  Careers are important because having one will not only mean that I won't starve, but that I'll have an opportunity to <i>change the world</i>.  As the career advice organization <a href="http://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a> notes you'll be spending about 80,000 hours in a career, so you might as well use it to make as big of a difference as you can?  <b>But what career should I pick?</b>

Here are my starting thoughts and strategy...<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Basic Philosophy and Strategy</h2>
My aim is to choose a career that will, taken as a whole, contribute the most to the world with regard to my utilitarian goals to increase total well-being.  "Taken as a whole" means that I'm not just considering the direct good of the first career itself, but also it's interaction with the rest of my life, it's indirect good, and how it might set me up to have an even better second career.

However, there is one catch: I furthermore want the job to be at least moderately enjoyable.  I would very much not like to be depressed or burnt out, and I suspect that would be bad for my utilitarian goals too.  If I think I would be miserable at my chosen job even if somehow it were to maximize total well-being, I still would not take it (despite this being immoral from a utilitarian standpoint).

I also would like to have a plan in place rather soon, so I can actually act upon preparing for it.  The earlier I pick a career plan, the more options will remain open.  Right now, I'm stuck, for better or for worse, with a psychology and political science major and unless I do something drastic, I won't be able to take any classes outside of those two majors for the rest of my time at Denison.

As a political science and psychology double major, I think I could be very well qualified for a job that involves research and/or statistics.  To get more of an idea of what I can do, feel free to <a href="http://www.peterhurford.com/resume.php">look at my résumé</a> at my <a href="http://www.peterhurford.com/">personal website</a>.  I'll speculate a bit more about my qualifications later on in this essay.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Scope of High-Impact Careers</h2>
The way I've been categorizing it, there are essentially only two different kinds of careers that promise to do lots of good -- <b>funneling money to effective organizations</b> and <b>working for effective organizations</b>, though some opportunities allow for some combination of both.

By effective organizations, I mean orgs like <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a>, <a href="http://www.80000hours.org/">80K Hours</a>, <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.com">Effective Animal Activism</a>, <a href="http://www.lifeyoucansave.com">The Life You Can Save</a>, <a href="http://www.rationality.org/">Center for Applied Rationality</a>, <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a>, <a href="http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">Future of Humanity Institute</a>, Leverage Research, <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org">Vegan Outreach</a>, etc.  (Of course, the actual choice of organization would matter a great deal, but I'm going to save that for later essays.) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Funneling money to effective organizations, in this case, involves only one opportunity -- <i>earning to give</i>, which I've <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/sunday-links-4-earning-to-give/">summarized before</a>. The basic idea is that you aim to pick a high income job and then donate as much as you can to an effective organization.

Working for effective organizations involves four other opportunities -- <i>research</i>, <i>influence</i>, <i>fundraising</i>, and/or <i>direct work</i>.  I say "and/or" because you could end up employed at a effective organization that allows you to so some combination of the four.  Research might involve working for a university working on an important question.  Direct work might involve assisting in the day-to-day opportunities of the organization.

Notably, research, influence, and perhaps even fundraising, could be carried out in one's free time, such as what I do through this blog.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My Perceived Opportunities in Earning to Give</h2>
I think earning to give is a great baseline for me to evaluate other opportunities from, even though I'm moderately confident I can do more impact through a different line of work.  What opportunities await?  Here are my guesses:

<ul>
<p><li><b>Investment Banking:</b> My guess is this is the highest earning career, when considering probability of achieving certain incomes multiplied by the quantity of income, and high incomes right out of college.  However, I'm only moderately qualified for it -- I think I have a good analytic mindset and have taken some economics and finance classes, but I'm not an economics major, and I've never done any finance internships.  Moreover, I don't think this job would be particularly enjoyable.  I see a high chance of failure to get a job and burnout once I get a job here.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Law:</b> Law seems like a high-earning career if you can make it big, but there's a low chance of making it big.  I've heard anecdotally that you basically need to get into a top law school or you won't be having a good time, assuming you can pay for that law school.  I think this would be moderately enjoyable and with Moot Court, a Constitutional law class, and a Political Science major, I'm as prepared for law as anyone can be in a liberal arts school.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Consulting:</b> Consulting offers high incomes right out of college, though the incomes might not be as high as other opportunities overall.  I'd say I'm as prepared for consulting as anyone can be in a liberal arts school, though I'm not an economics major.  Unfortunately, however, I'd guess that I'd really hate regular travel, so consulting might not be a good career path for me.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Computer Programming:</b> Computer programming also offers high incomes right out of college, provided you're talented at it.  I think I have the raw aptitude, but I don't have the formal training.  My guess is that if I wanted to go into programming, I'd have to pursue some additional education after Denison.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Market Research:</b> I think market research would also offer decently high incomes right out of college, and I'd be well qualified for it and I'd enjoy it.  This has always been one of my favorite choices.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Engineering:</b> Engineering would provide high incomes right out of college, but I have no experience with engineering.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Medicine:</b>  Doctors earn a lot, though they have high expenses with medical school.  Doctors seem to be like lawyers who have a more smooth earnings curve -- you'll earn a bit less overall, but you have a higher chance of success.  However, I don't think this is worth pursuing as I have no interest for it and I have never taken a single college-level biology course.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My Perceived Opportunities in Research</h2>
I've done really, really well in political science and think I'd have lots of aptitude as a political science Ph.D.  However, I don't think political science offers much opportunities to actually make an impact with one's research.  Psychology research, on the other hand, I do think has a wide variety of high impact questions to study, but I've only been moderately good at psychology and I'm unsure I'd get into a top Ph.D. program.  I also imagine I might have the general skills to survive in other social science programs, like economics research.

I thought about doing philosophy research, since most of the biggest questions seem to lie in the realm of philosophy right now.  However, I'm nearly certain I can do just as well or even better at philosophy research by just writing for this blog.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My Perceived Opportunities in Influence/Fundraising</h2>
I don't know if there's much I could do in influence beyond what I'm already doing.  I suspect my only options are to either <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/">retire early</a> and blog full-time (it's not that hard to retire permanently by age 30 with a high enough income and savings rate).  That seems unlikely to be my best choice.

I could go work on behalf of an effective organization, which seems promising.

Or I could always retire early and then work for an effective organization, as well, which would have the added benefit of not needing them to pay me.

A career in politics is unlikely to be high impact as a first career, and I've probably already burned myself from running for higher office with public statements of outside-the-mainstream views.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My Perceived Opportunities in Direct Work</h2>
I think this is the same as the above.  I think I'd enjoy working for an effective organization directly.

One interesting idea is to <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/54-the-high-impact-pa-how-anyone-can-bring-about-ground-breaking-research">be a personal assistant</a> to someone who is high-impact to boost their impact.  I'm not sure how good I am at this, however, and I'd feel like I could do better.  I'm also not sure if this would be fun, though it could be.  I suppose it depends on the person I'd work with.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This essay is good in making my career plans a lot less vague.  But it's full of guesses and I'm definitely missing a lot.  What do I plan on doing from here?

<ul>
<p><li><b>Get a significant amount of advice on this draft.</b>  I'll be visiting England this summer and hope to stop by 80K and get advice from a bunch of cool people in person.  I'll sign up for another <a href="http://80000hours.org/get-coaching">80k coaching session</a> (my first one got a bit derailed).  I also plan on talking to people not affiliated with 80K.  Just by passing this draft around, I hope to get more advice on how to modify it. (Hint: You should give me advice or tell me how to find good advice.)</li></p>

<p><li><b>Do more personal research.</b>  80K has a lot of research, but they might not be going fast enough for me to make it in time, and I might need to pick up some of what they don't have, to the best of my ability.  Finding salary information for my favorite jobs would be a good start.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Choose a few paths to pursue and build toward them.</b>  I can apply to jobs and graduate programs simultaneously while still figuring things out.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Work on the LSAT and GRE.</b>  I need to take these two tests for law school and Ph.D. programs respectively.  I also might need graduate school for non-Ph.D. career advancement.  I'll get the practice tests ready.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Keep updating this blog.</b>  I'd imagine there's a lot of benefit for both me and others in creating more documentation and discussion around career choice for making the world a better place.</li></p>
</ul>

<blockquote>The main challenge is the sheer volume of reading.</blockquote>

If I like the material, this won't be an issue.  If I don't like the material (find it interesting and/or useful), this will be a huge issue.  So far I've been able to read cases just fine for Moot Court, but I could see this changing.

<blockquote>A law degree can be very helpful even if you don’t practice law.</blockquote>

I've thought that it could be useful to be a lawyer that can work with effective organizations on their legal needs.  Could be a good way to combine both.

<blockquote>While working in high-powered Manhattan law firms, I met many lawyers who became multimillionaires by the age of 35 and kept their moral compasses in the process.</blockquote>

How common is that?  I haven't seen a lawyer that is both wealthy and fulfilled.  But I only pull from the subsample of lawyers that come to speak to college and high school kids.

Do you know what average and median salaries in law are like?

<blockquote>I’m a computer programmer now, and I really enjoy it. I did not major in comp sci, but I did take a few classes in it, which really helped.</blockquote>

How'd you get into computer programming?  What does it take to get hired?  (I assume it's more than a "few classes", but perhaps not.)

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

Roughly:

Lawyers I've worked with: 300
Lawyers among those I've worked with who have a solid moral compass in my opinion: 100
Lawyers among those I've worked with who were multimillionaires by 35: 50
Overlap between the preceding two groups: 25

Would those people call themselves &quot;fulfilled&quot;? I couldn't say. They worked very hard and had little time for family, but the bachelors seemed happy enough.

<blockquote>

No, but you should be able to find this. I'd do some poking around for you if I weren't in the middle of a road trip.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

I had been programming as an amateur since I was a pre-teen. When I found myself between jobs, living in the NYC area, in 1999, taking a temporary job doing web sites was a no-brainer. What I didn't expect was that it would turn into a whole new career. The dot-com boom had that effect on people.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

I'm seeing starting salaries from about $55k through $75k, depending on education and region. With a few years experience, six-figures is common in some regions.

</blockquote>

I don't know how common it is. Knowing you from you your blog writings, I can say with confidence that you would have a strong chance of achieving any goal you set for yourself vis-a-vie other law school graduates. I've long known that your writing skills are, as an undergraduate, already a match for just about any first-year associate I've worked with and more than half of the experienced attorneys. Hearing that you have participated in and enjoyed moot court is a good sign too, though you can do very will as a lawyer without ever going to trial.

<blockquote>
2.) Why did you leave law for programming?
</blockquote>

Bear in mind that I was a law librarian, and in my mind the emphasis was on the librarian part. So it was more a matter of leaving librarianship than law.


I had been fired from my job. While looking for my next &quot;real&quot; job, I took a three-day contract writing a simple web application for a major marketing firm. They liked me, and I liked them, so the contract continued indefinitely. That paid $50 per hour. At 40 hours a week, that's about the same I was making as a law librarian, but without benefits. I continued to look for a new librarian position for about a year, but with decreasing enthusiasm. There were two factors that contributed to my eventually giving up: (1), I found that I was enjoying myself more. I had invested a great deal of my identity in being a librarian, which I viewed as a noble profession (and still do). This paradoxically made it harder to enjoy doing it, because I would beat myself up for making small mistakes. Programming is just fun for me. (2) It was the dot-com boom, and the opportunities were stunning. Even from the get-go, I often worked 80 hours per week, which was great money. Before long, I was making $1000 per diem. This allowed me to pay off my student loans only four years after graduating (they were about $100,000 when I graduated) AND buy my first house with a 70% down-payment. My wife grew up in China during the cultural revolution, so she had different ideas about work-life balance. She liked the extra security that the money brought, and it was common in her experience for married couples to spend a lot of time apart in pursuit of career. So she was very much in favor of riding this gravy train as long as it lasted.

Hi Peter,


It's <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/free-as-in-prepaid" rel="nofollow">me</a> again.


I'm a law school graduate, and thus feel qualified to comment on your law school option. But don't take this as an endorsement of law school over your other options.


I think you'd enjoy law school and do well in it. Anyone who can read and understand a <a href="lesswrong.com" rel="nofollow">Less Wrong</a> sequence will have no problem with law. The main challenge is the sheer volume of reading. I'm not a fast reader, and I often found it difficult to keep up. Missing a day due to illness can be a real hardship. But I've seen people of mediocre intelligence graduate near the top of their class because they were motivated and disciplined.


Moot court is indeed fun and teaches valuable and transferable skills. I had an opportunity to compete regionally, and that was a fantastic experience.


A law degree can be very helpful even if you don't practice law. I went to law school and library school concurrently with the goal of becoming a law librarian. I did this for three years before moving on to computer programming (see below). I continue to find the law degree helpful in my current career; the library degree not so much. Of course, that's a lot of money for a degree that's merely helpful as opposed to directly relevant.


While working in high-powered Manhattan law firms, I met many lawyers who became multimillionaires by the age of 35 and kept their moral compasses in the process. While there's no denying that large law firms are full of pettiness and back-stabbing, those who take the high road generally do well by earning the respect and trust of their peers. Just remember that taking the high road doesn't mean being naïve nor walking around with a welcome mat on your back.


I'm a computer programmer now, and I really enjoy it. I did not major in comp sci, but I did take a few classes in it, which really helped. Programming gives me an optimal balance between enjoyment and earn-to-give potential. But for raw earn-to-give potential, it doesn't compete with law practice.


If you get serious about law school, consider my alma mater: Vermont Law School. When I attended in the mid 90's, it had a great vibe. The faculty and students were by-and-large decent, compassionate people, who would fully understand and support your goals.


Best of luck!

Presumably, if the person is guilty, and they have some sort of evidence of their own guilt, than shouldn't they ought to be compelled to provide that evidence, given that it helps put punish a guilty person?  The problems, then, are really in the nature of the coercion and whether this coercion would negatively effect innocent people enough as to be worth it.  But that seems better stopped by outlawing "cruel and unusual tactics" and regulating interrogation better.  To be clear, I'm not saying I don't like the "right to remain silent", just that I can't currently make sense of it.

				<title>For Impact, The Future Matters More</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/giving-now-currently-seems-to-beat-giving-later/">Giving Now Currently Seems To Beat Giving Later</a></b>

Thinking about <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">analyzing cost-effectiveness for vegetarian outreach</a>, has made me think more about where philanthropic dollars should go in order to do the most amount of good.  Most people just give to whatever charities come their way, send them advertisements, etc.  A lot of people are also concerned with giving back to their local community, supporting their church, or their university.

I don't condemn any of those motivations -- I think they're wonderful, local communities do deserve support, and there's something to be said for "paying it forward" and giving back to those who have set you up for success.  But I'm mostly concerned with what one should do with the goal to <a href="">improve the world as much as possible</a> (on the assumption that all interests count equally), and I've changed the way I think.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My (Previous) Way of Thinking</h2>
The way I have always thought about philanthropy, however, was to be <i>cause blind</i>, and think solely on giving wherever I could do the most.  If one opportunity came up where I could help someone cope with blindness by spending $50000 to get them a seeing eye dog, and another opportunity came up where I could cure blindness altogether through $25 cataract surgery, I would jump at the opportunity to fund the $25 surgery.  I wouldn't care if that person were all the way in Africa and the blind person needing the seeing eye dog were in my local community.

It's not that I don't care about the local blind person.  It's that I also care about the non-local blind person, and that I could treat 2000 people like him or her for the same amount of money.  I think it's ludicrous for the local blind person to insist that she or he is 2000x more valuable to me solely because he or she lives nearby.  I noticed that <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">where I gave is literally a matter of life and death</a>, so I was very motivated to get this question right.

This is the general philosophy of <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>, and <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/">Effective Animal Activism</a> -- investigate lots of non-profits, find the one organization that can do the most good with an additional dollar, and give them a dollar.  ...Or far more.

However, I've recently come to see that this way of thinking is incomplete; perhaps even mistaken.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Far Future Blind Spot</h2>
When I've been thinking about giving opportunities and their quantification, I've been thinking firmly in the present.  In my previous way of thinking, I would look at <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a> and see that it can save a life for about $2000.  I'd then compare it to my cost-estimates and other cost-estimates, weigh the differences in quality of evidence, and arrive at a decision.

But, when I was considering this $2000 to save a life, I never thought to question what it actually means to "save a life".  The person I save may, instead of dying at age five from malaria, go on <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2007/12/04/what-a-life-saved-means/">to live a pretty decent life</a>, but still die of old age at 60.  I haven't "saved" the life -- instead, I've happily extended it by 55 years.

But I'm also not considering the further impacts of extending this life.  It turns out that by helping reduce the mortality burden of malaria, I'm helping to <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2008/08/03/infant-mortality-and-overpopulation/">lead people to have less children overall</a>, because parents in the developing world have less kids when they're less concerned their kids will die of malaria.  Overall, this is going to <i>prevent</i> many years of life that otherwise would have been lived.

So where is my actual impact?  More realistically, it's not in "saving a life", but rather in reducing overpopulation, helping to reduce concerns from malaria, and helping turn people's attention to better and happier things.  In saving a life, I'm really helping to develop the developing world.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The same is true in considering Vegan Outreach.  Sure my two pennies might, under more optimistic assumptions, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">be all that is needed to prevent a year of intense animal suffering</a>.  But my real impact is going to be from making the person I've helped indirectly convert to vegetarianism more compassionate, more likely to recruit others, and more likely to get the ball rolling on ending factory farming.

Right now, there are billions of people alive, hundreds of billions of factory-farmed animals, and trillions of nonhuman animals in the wild.  There's a lot I can do to help them, and I do my best to care about all of them.  But this pales in comparison to the trillions of people and the quadrillions of nonhuman animals who will be born over the next thousands of years, and I want them to have good lives too.

If I can change the present a little bit, I may help the people alive now a little bit.  But, through compounding effects, movement building, and momentum, I'll have a lot more impact on the people in the farther future.  I just might not be able to quantify it.

To be fair, GiveWell has been looking away from the "cost of a life" metric and toward measures of economic development.  But this way of thinking for the far future is pretty alien to most people, and was alien to me even back in Dec 2012.  I don't think we should discard quantification altogether, of course.  But I do think it needs to be retooled in our thoughts toward focusing on where the real impact may lie, not in quantifying our marginal, more minimal impact on the present.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Streetlight Dilemma</h2>
An old parable goes as follows:

<blockquote>Late one evening a police officer comes across a man on the way home from a party. He is quite drunk and looking for something under a streetlight.

"What are you looking for?" asks the policeman.

"My keys," the man replies, pointing down the road a little way, "I dropped them somewhere way over there."

The policeman is baffled, "Then why are you looking for them here?".

"Because there’s no light over there.  The light is over here"</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Obviously, we would reject the behavior of the drunk man in the parable as irrational -- no matter how much light is over where he's looking, he's not going to find his keys, because they're not in the light.

The bottom goal of all of my donating has been to have the largest impact per dollar, in utilitarian terms of making lives go better.  Currently, I've been looking at the opportunities that can be easily quantified.  <b>However, I have been ignoring the opportunities that cannot be quantified.</b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Applying the metaphor of the streetlight, quantification is that very light -- only certain things can be quantified easily.  I, put not so kindly, are the drunk person, searching in the light of easy quantification because... well... that's where the quantification is.  Even if the best opportunity for maximal impact exists somewhere else.

Of course, there's something to be said for the streetlight.  Givewell writes <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2011/05/27/in-defense-of-the-streetlight-effect/">"In Defense of the Streetlight Effect"</a>, pointing out that there are plenty of good opportunities to be explored within the areas of easy quantification, and I agree.  On an impact per dollar point-of-view, there is a lot to be gained by switching from the Seeing Eye Dog charity to the cataract surgery charity, based on our assessment of their impact.  GiveWell's <a href="http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">top charities</a> do really great work for not that much money, and are definitely worth funding.

But on the other end, a lot still needs to be done with the streetlight.  Abusing the metaphor, we can spend money hiring more people to look in the streetlight.  We can pay money to build more streetlights and better streetlights.  If we only stayed within the streetlight and never strayed out, we'd be stuck with the first good, quantified thing we find.

But if we stick only on expanding the streetlight and never on any of the things we find, then we'll never get anything done.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Ditching the metaphor for some clarity, the tension I'm exploring is that of first-order tasks vs. second-order tasks that make the first-order tasks go better.  Especially when applying long-term thinking, there's a lot of impact to be had from improving first-order tasks.  There's likely also a lot of impact to be had from improving second-order tasks as well.

And, of course, the distinction between what's in the streetlight and what's outside the streetlight isn't as distinct as bright light vs. dark night.  Instead, there are shades of grey upon which reasonable guesses about impact can be made, even amid uncertainty.  The point is not to take these rough estimates as given (instead, we should probably subject them to lots of skepticism, perhaps even more than is typical) nor to give up quantification altogether, but rather to use these less certain conclusions to inform our decisions and not restrict ourselves to a particular level of confidence.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Going Meta With My Money</h2>
So where am I planning on giving my (meager college student) money now?

With a look toward the far future, existential risk reduction looks like a much better bet.  But, more realistically, I have to say that no one I know has a convincing enough answer yet on where we should donate.  There's a lot of good work to be done in reducing existential risk, in reducing nonhuman animal suffering, and in raising the standard of living for the developing world.  But I earnestly can't tell which opportunity is the smartest.

I had thought at first I should just start saving my money and wait until either I die, or a convincing enough answer comes along.  But then I thought that there's a lot that can be done by just recruiting more and more people to start thinking about these problems.  If I can recruit just one person to think about these problems as deeply and as intelligently as I currently am (or more!), I will have doubled my impact.  Then, imagine what happens if they start recruiting people as well!

So, I want to invest my money in the movement.  Effective Animal Activism was a pretty good bet, though now for completely different reasons than I once thought.  I'm going to start giving my meager college student money toward <a href="http://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">The Centre for Effective Altruism</a>, which does a lot to collect a group of people together to think about where to give and to give more.

Normally, I would be concerned about not doing any first-order actions and actually doing something.  But I'm reassured that lots of other people are donating their money directly to high-impact activities, and that I'm unlikely to persuade so many people that I upset this balance.  Instead, I think there's a good chance that not only could I get more than $1 to go to a good cause for every $1 I give them!

After all, if they didn't exist, I very likely never would have even started thinking about these issues, let alone giving much money at all.

				<title>Buying Vegetarians: Addressing Criticism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Continuation of <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/buying-vegetarians-handling-complications/">Buying Vegetarians: Handling Complications</a></b>

Recently, I’ve been trying to figure out how much it costs to save animals from factory farming. The idea is to get people to become vegetarian by funding advertisements to influence them.  Previously <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">I did a simple calculation</a> and came up with two cents to avert a year of suffering in a factory farm.  Then <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/buying-vegetarians-handling-complications/">I did a more complex calculation</a> and came up with a range between two cents to $65.92 to avert a year of suffering.

Many people are skeptical of these figures.  Perhaps surprisingly, so am I.  I'm trying to strike a balance between being an advocate of vegan outreach as a very promising path for making the world a better place, while not losing sight of the methodological hurdles that have not yet been met, and open to the possibility that I'm <i>wrong about this</i>.

In this essay, I'm going to discuss those hurdles.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Quality of the Surveys</h2>
The big methodological elephant in the room is that my entire cost estimate depends on having a plausible guess for how likely someone is to change their behavior based on seeing an advertisement.

I feel slightly reassured because:
<ol>
<li>There are <i>two</i> surveys for two different media, and they both provide estimates of impact that agree with each other.</li>
<li>These estimates also match anecdotes from leafleters about approximately how many people come back and say they went vegetarian because of a pamphlet.</li>
<li>Even if we were to take the simple calculator and drop the "2% chance of getting four years of vegetarianism" assumption down to, say, a pessimistic "0.1% chance of getting one year" conversion rate, the estimate is still not too bad -- $0.91 to avert a year of suffering.</li>
<li>More studies are on the way.  Nick Cooney is going to do a bunch more to study leaflets, and Xio Kikauka and Joey Savoie﻿ <a href="http://docs.google.com/document/d/1jevjZhf4W3of4KrswoeiEHheUbNguRABBM6Cdk04dvs/edit">have publicly published some survey methodology</a> [Google Docs].</li>
</ol>

That said, the <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-04-15">possibility for desirability bias in the survey</a> is a large concern as long as the surveys continue to be from overt animal welfare groups and continue to clearly state that they're looking for reductions in meat consumption.

Also, so long as surveys are only given to people that remember the leaflet or advertisement, there will be a strong possibility of response bias, as those who remember the ad are more likely to be the ones who changed their behavior.

Furthermore, there's a concern that the surveys are just measuring normal drift in vegetarianism, without any changes being attributable to the ads themselves.  For example, imagine that every year, 2% of people become vegetarians and 2% quit.  Surveying these people at random and not capturing those who quit will end up finding a 2% conversion rate.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
How can we address these?  <b>I think all three problems can be solved with a decent control group</b>, whether it be a group of people that receive a leaflet not about vegetarianism, or no leaflet at all.  Luckily, Kikauka and Savoie's survey intend to do just that.

<a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-05-07">Jeff Kaufman has a good proposal for a survey design</a> I'd like to see implemented in this area.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Market Saturation and Diminishing Marginal Returns</h2>
Another concern is that there are diminishing marginal returns to these ads.  As the critique goes, there are only so many people that will be easily swayed by the advertisement, and once all of them are quickly reached by Facebook ads and pamphlets, things will dry up.

Unlike the others, I don't think this criticism works well.  After all, even if it were true, it still would be worthwhile to take the market as far as it will go, and we can keep monitoring for saturation and find the point where it's no longer cost-effective.

However, I don't think the market has been tapped up yet at all.  <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/facebook-veg-ads.pdf">According to Nick Cooney</a> [PDF], there are still many opportunities in foreign markets and outside the young, college kid demographic.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Conjunction Fallacy</h2>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy">conjunction fallacy</a> is a classic fallacy that reminds us that no matter what, the chance of event A happening can never be smaller than the chance of event A happening, followed by event B.  For example, the probability that Linda is a bank teller will always be larger than (or equal to) the probability that Linda is a bank teller and a feminist.

What does this mean for vegetarian outreach?  Well, for the simple calculator, we're estimating five factors.  In the complex calculator, we're estimating 90 factors.  Even if each factor is 99% likely to be correct, the chance that all five are right is 95%, and the chance that all 50 are right is only 60%.  If each factor is only 90% likely to be correct, the complex calculator will be right with a probability of 0.5%!

This is a cause for concern, but I don't think there's any way around this.  It's just an inherent problem with estimation.  Hopefully we'll be balanced by (1) using the different bounds and (2) hoping underestimates and overestimates will cancel each other out.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conversion and The 100 Yard Line</h2>
Something we should take into account that <i>helps</i> the case for this outreach rather than hurts it is the idea that conversions aren't binary -- someone can be pushed by the ad to be more likely to reduce their meat intake as opposed to fully converted.  As <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?t=786">Brian Tomasik puts it</a>:

<blockquote>Yes, some of the people we convince were already on the border, but there might be lots of other people who get pushed further along and don’t get all the way to vegism by our influence. If we picture the path to vegism as a 100-yard line, then maybe we push everyone along by 20 yards. 1/5 of people cross the line, and this is what we see, but the other 4/5 get pushed closer too. (Obviously an overly simplistic model, but it illustrates the idea.)</blockquote>

This would be either very difficult or outright impossible to capture in a survey, but is something to take into account.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Three Places I Might Donate Before Donating to Vegan Outreach</h2>
When all is said and done, I like the case for funding this outreach.  However, I think there are three other possibilities along these lines that I find more promising:

<b>Funding the <i>research</i> of vegan outreach:</b> There needs to be more and higher-quality studies of this before one can feel confident enough in the cost-effectiveness of this outreach.  However, initial results are very promising, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information">value of information</a> of more studies is therefore very high.  Studies can also find ways to advertise <i>more effectively</i>, increasing the impact of each dollar spent.  Right now, however, it looks like all ongoing studies are fully funded, but if there were opportunities to fund more, I would jump on it.

<b>Funding <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/">Effective Animal Activism</a>:</b> EAA is pushing for more cost-effectiveness in the domain of nonhuman animal welfare and is working to further evaluate what opportunities are the best, Givewell-style.  Giving them more money can potentially attract a lot more attention to this outreach, and get it more scrutiny, research, and money down the line.

<b>Funding <a href="http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>:</b> Overall, it might just be better to get more people involved in the idea of giving effectively, and then getting them interested in vegan outreach, among other things.  CEA could do just that.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Vegan outreach is a promising, though not fully studied, method of outreach that deserves both excitement and skepticism.  Should one put money into it?  Overall, I'd take a guarded approach of putting in just enough money to help the organizations learn, develop better cost-effective measurements and transparency, and become more effective.  It shouldn't be too long before this area will become studied well enough to have good confidence in how things are doing.

More studies should be developed that explore advertising vegetarianism in a wide variety of media in a wide variety of ways, with decent control groups.

I look forward to seeing how this develops.  <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/">Don't forget to play around with my calculator</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Why blog?</b>  In Harry Potter, Dumbledore stores his thoughts in a <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pensieve">pensieve</a>.  However, such magical technology already exists for us in a less awesome form: diaries and blogs.

The desire to blog nearly has always started with me feeling overwhelmed by having too many thoughts in my head.  I notice that I can't think clearly, because focusing on one thought in particular ends up with me losing some of my other thoughts.  This creates a somewhat unpleasant feeling and loss of focus.

But the pensieve model brings a solution -- I can make use of what has been called by certain academics as an "external memory field", and by most nearly everyone else as "paper" or "word documents" to type up my thoughts.  Then, I can get rid of my thoughts from my (internal) mind and think without worry of loss.

Spencer Greenberg writes that <a href="http://www.spencergreenberg.com/2011/07/do-we-really-read-non-fiction-to-learn/">it's rather pointless to try to read non-fiction with the intent to learn</a> unless you're also taking notes, potentially doubling the effectiveness of your time spent reading or more.  Since I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-reading/">read a lot of books</a>, it would behoove me to summarize what I've read to make sure that I actually learn the material.

I can then come back to thoughts that I've stored days, weeks, months, or years older and retrieve them.  It's really fun to read what I wrote a year ago and try to shift back into my old frame of mind.  Sometimes, old writing of mine is as unfamiliar to me as the writing of other people.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Organizing Information</h4>
For me, however, thoughts aren't really good enough; I want to record thoughts <i>in action</i>.  Writing thoughts not only stores them, but gives them greater clarity and cohesiveness than they ever would have had in my head.  I also can make use of hyperlinks to string thoughts together, and reference the thoughts of others.

I can also revisit and build upon thoughts that I have stored in a way that wouldn't be possible inside my own head.  Putting things to paper just gives me more space to work with, and by being goal oriented, I can use this space to hopefully solve tough and interesting problems; perhaps even the most important problems facing us today.

Most importantly to me, this reason and the last reason motivate me to keep up a blog <i>even when no-one is reading it</i>.  Luckily for me, this isn't the case, but even it were, I would still blog.  Writing with the intent to get as many people to read it as possible is often self-destructive to the ends of accurately writing about what I think and what interests <i>me</i>.  I don't want to worry about readership.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Benefits of Discussion</h4>
The past two reasons explain some of why it would be important to keep a diary and why it would be easier to do so <i>online</i>.   But why make it public?  Well first, it satisfies my need for a creative outlet; to produce something and give it to the world.  But it also allows me to collect feedback, to hone my craft, and improve my thoughts.

Malcolm Gladwell says <a href="http://www.amazon.comdp/0316017930">it takes 10,000 hours with constant feedback</a> to become an expert.  There has been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/review/Pinker-t.html?pagewanted=all">enough</a> <a href="http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/52014/index1.html">criticism</a> of <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/30/malcolm_gladwell_no/">Gladwell</a> for me to not take that number seriously, but the fact remains that while I've been thinking for over 100,000 hours to date, I have barely any feedback.  I am by no means an expert at thinking.

I hope to use feedback and criticism to improve my own writing and thinking.  I also hope to make it a two-way street and improve the thinking of others.  I even have lofty goals to use my writing to persuade.

We'll see if I ever get to that step.  Perhaps you could <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">get your own blog</a> and join me.  Or, revive a blog if you have it.  Remember not to worry about whether people are reading it.

I'm stopping to note the impact you've had on my own writing. Your writerly habit is assiduous, your output constant, and your words clear. You write some of the simplest English I've ever seen (this is a compliment). If it weren't for you, for this blog, I may not have decided to formalise my own desire to write, would not have started my own blog, would have forgone the obligation to improve myself in this manner out of apathy and lack of example. Perhaps it's shameful that I need an example to kick my slovenly ass into action, but, in any case, your work has been that motivating boot. Thanks.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'd like to get better at debating charitably.  <a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=15703">This guide is a good place to start</a>.

Just a reminder that Immanuel Kant had <a href="http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.kr/2010/03/kant-on-killing-bastards-on.html">non-progressive atypical-by-modern-standards views</a>; like women don't have rights; children born out of wedlock don't have rights; homosexuality and masturbation are abhorrent; and organ donation (and even hair donation) is basically partial suicide (and suicide is very wrong, by the way).  I'm not sure how much of a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> this is for Kantian deontology, but it is a prime example of how easy it is to make your moral theory conveniently confirm the standard cultural practices and biases of your time.  (I don't think utilitarianism is off the hook for this, but it certainly has a better track record.)

80,000 Hours tells me about two things that are dangerous that I didn't think were dangerous: <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/93-why-most-charity-fundraisers-cause-harm">charity fundraisers</a> (because they tend to shift donations around rather than outright raise donations, though see many caveats and clarifications) and <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/89-why-attractive-people-are-dangerous">attractive people</a> (because they're more persuasive when they shouldn't be, though my girlfriend should be excluded from this).<!--more-->

It's really sad to see how much animal abuse in farming is caused not by people eating meat, but <a href="http://www.countinganimals.com/animals-we-use-and-abuse-for-food-we-do-not-eat/">people wasting it</a>.  I remember one girl I met who ate meat, but took very special care to never waste any meat she ate and never to take more meat than she was planning on eating, because she wanted to respect the fact that an animal died for her food.

The concept of being careful <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/">not to generalize from one example</a> (i.e. from you, to other people) must be important because I like it.  One of the reasons you should <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/dont-take-my-advice-too-seriously/">be careful of (my) advice</a>.

This is a very strange and enlightening view of the mind <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/20/the_apologist_and_the_revolutionary/">as an apologist and a revolutionary</a>, coming out of strange and enlightening findings in neuroscience like split-brain studies.

<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/4su/how_to_be_happy/">A good practical guide to becoming happier</a>, rooted in positive psychology research.

A bit on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/04/can-super-mario-save-artificial-intelligence.html">adapting artificial intelligence to play games without being specifically programmed for them</a>.  I like the part on how the program solves Tetris: "It can’t win[...], but it figures out that, if it pauses the game and doesn’t restart, it won’t lose."

I don't read much on atheism-religion arguments anymore, but I really like <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/343999.html">this analysis of Lewis's Lord-Liar-Lunatic trilemma</a>.  Though, <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/324957.html">perhaps Jesus could be a lunatic after all</a>...

One of my favorite essays of all time: <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues">The Twelve Virtues of Rationality</a>.

An <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ib/the_proper_use_of_doubt/">analysis of the proper use of doubt</a>.

A good question to get in the habit of asking: <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2007/05/29/its-for-charity-but-is-it-for-a-good-cause/">it's for charity, but is it for a good cause?</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One interesting idea comes from <a href="http://thelifeyoucansave.blogspot.com/2009/06/special-guest-blog.html">"How Students Can Support a Millennium Village?"</a>, which talks about, obviously, funding a Millenium Village:  (See also <a href="http://newsroom.carleton.ca/2009/04/02/carleton-students-approve-student-levy-for-millennium-villages-project/">the school's news report</a>.)

<blockquote>Last year at Carleton University our group, Students To End Extreme Poverty, worked to get a question to referendum where students voted on whether or not they would all have to automatically pay an additional $6 in tuition fees ($5352 instead of $5346) to help support a Millennium Village. It worked. Carleton students now contribute over $110,000 annually.

Here is our hope: By getting enough universities and organizations to support Millennium Villages (aside from helping a couple communities help themselves out of extreme poverty) it would raise enough awareness, get enough media attention, engage enough people, foster enough cooperation, and generate enough civil society will to see policy changes: more and better aid, fairer trade, and debt cancellation.

Worst case scenario: thousands of people, many of whom would otherwise be dead, will have the basic tools they need to lift themselves out of extreme poverty.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Might this be a plausible thing to try and do on other college campuses?<!--more-->

With an additional $6 per student, at my university, Denison University, we could raise $12,792 per year in philanthropy.  To reach Carleton's level, we'd need $51.80 per student per year.  At $12,792, we could fund 213 people to <a href="http://www.millenniumvillages.org/the-villages">live in a Millenium Village</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Impact of College Philanthropy</h2>
What exactly is the impact of college philanthropy?  Philanthropic dollars certainly aren't useless, and the age-old saying that "anything helps" is certainly true.  But many social problems would require money on the scale of millions, if not billions, of dollars to help solve.  Student giving is typically on the scale of thousands.  Raise $10 from each of Denison's students, and you'll be getting $21320, assuming everyone contributes.  What's that worth?

<b>College philanthropy raises awareness.</b> A liberal arts school, such as Denison, wants to provide training to students in recognizing (and hopefully responding to) social issues.  By raising money for a cause, one is able to raise awareness for the cause by educating people about it.  Hopefully this raised awareness will translate into more action around the issue further dwn the road, even if money can't be raised more.  It signals that this issue is one worth taking seriously.

<b>$21230 can do some good on it's own.</b>  It's enough to provide a scholarship to fund a semester of tuition and costs for one student.  It's enough to <a href="http://www.eriefoodbank.org/Content.aspx?Section=about-us">buy 148000 pounds of food for a food pantry</a>.  It's enough to fund 5000 <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/WhyNets.aspx">anti-malaria bed nets</a>.  It's enough to <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto/whatwedo">fund over 40,000 deworming treatments</a>.  Don't underestimate the impact of $21230.

<b>College philanthropy builds a giving habit.</b>  Perhaps most importantly, students giving now help cement the habit of giving in the future when they have much more to give.  Colleges recognize that <a href="http://www.slate.com/content/slate/blogs/scocca/2010/10/27/cornell_and_dartmouth_shame_students_for_not_adding_their_real_money_to_the_ongoing_bonfire_of_imaginary_money.html">senior class gifts often make up <0.01% of their endowments</a> and often put more money into fundraising than they immediately return, with the acknowledgement that the real return comes further down the road -- <a href="http://yaleherald.com/news-and-features/features/giving-in-or-not-strife-solicitation-and-the-senior-class-gift/">"One day, it’s five dollars; later it’s 5,000; in 2042, Yale gets Smith Tower or the Johnson Fellowship."</a>  And while causation between earlier giving and later giving is still unclear, the correlation has been found to be rather strong (<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/ceps/workingpapers/210rosen.pdf">Rosen and Sims 2010, PDF</a>; <a href="http://econweb.tamu.edu/jmeer/Meer_Habit_of_Giving_FINAL.pdf">Meer 2011, PDF</a>).  $21230 raised now could easily become $2 million raised within ten years.

<b>It improves the reputation and desirability of the university.</b> People would see students engaged in this kind of project and understand that students at this university do come together and care about social problems outside their world; they're not just trapped in a bubble.  And the university could get favorable press coverage from the new policy.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Thinking Through the Idea</h2>
However, I have some questions:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Is Millenium Villages the best philanthropy?</h4>
The trade-off I imagine here is between the impact-per-person of the chosen cause and the likeliness that students will choose to endorse it.  GiveWell, a non-profit evaluator, <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/18/millennium-villages-project/">has criticized</a> Millenium Village has not yet "demonstrated cost-effective or sustainable benefits".  GiveWell's <a href="http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">top charities</a> would likely do better.  Much stranger causes, like vegan outreach or existential risk, I think potentially have even higher impact, but are extremely unlikely to attract people to signing on.

One might also consider helping the local community surrounding the college; in Denison's case, Licking County.  There certainly is need in the area, with several low-income areas, like Newark.  My push back against this would be that <a href="http://www.givewell.org/want-to-change-peoples-lives-give-internationally">the need is significantly higher overseas</a> and Denison is already putting money and service hours into the local community.  But the desire to support a local community is very high, much more so than overseas.

Perhaps we could consider splitting?  Or perhaps the split would just confuse people, making them overall less likely to support the idea?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Is the tuition raise the best model?</h4>
The interesting thing about Carleton's model is that they're not just getting behind tables and asking students who walk by to put money in a box.  Instead, students were voting on whether to pass the small levy onto all students.  It was optional in the sense that students could have voted the levy down and rejected the increase, but it's mandatory in the sense that the levy passing meant that even students who voted no would be coerced into donation as part of their student fees.

This plan has some important benefits.  I think the coercion is an important effect -- people are more likely to donate when others around them are doing so and being secure in the knowledge that everyone will have to contribute the same should make people more likely to get engaged.  And it also is a lot more successful at raising money than normal fundraisers, given that 100% participation is very unlikely.

However, there are drawbacks.  By introducing the levy and then forgetting about it, one gains the initial donation, but loses the opportunity to raise awareness or set students up to be <i>future</i> donors, which probably has more impact than the initial donation itself.  And there's an issue of unfairness -- those who vote "no" are still being coerced and given that students also graduate and are slowly replaced, it might be unfair to pass this cost on to future students as well.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
There are some alternatives that could get most of the benefits while also getting rid of some of the drawbacks.

Perhaps one could add a check box to the tuition bill that allows one to optionally add the $6 to their tuition bill.  Or perhaps one could take a page out of knowing that people are far less likely to opt-in than they are to opt-out and go for opt-out philanthropy, enable the donation by default, and make people check the box if they want to be <i>removed</i> from the donation pool.

Furthermore, perhaps the levy could come up for a vote every year.  Assuming the levy keeps getting passed, this would have the benefit of continuing the program, while also annually raising awareness for the cause and hopefully encouraging students to donate after they graduate.  Of course, this "risks" ending the levy, which would be unfortunate for those whom the levy benefits, but would give people an outlet to address the unfairness of coercion.

I suppose one could also ditch the levy model altogether and go back to the fundraising behind the table kind of deal that's pretty popular (and occasionally still enormously successful) with senior class gifts already.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Is $6 per student the best target?</h4>
There's also the trade-off of being able to raise even more money by asking for more, but turning off those who won't give the higher amount, but would have given a lower amount.

With a levy, this consideration is important, because people might oppose it solely based on the amount of money it intends to raise.  It seems that the $6 wouldn't be controversial in the same way my non-serious $51.80 suggestion would be, for example.

Of course, one could modify the levy model so that people can define their own amount they want to give, perhaps even allowing for one to give $0, thus allowing people to give as much or as little as they wanted.  But by coercing everyone to give a certain amount, one is likely to get more money than one would've otherwise, I think.

When I first heard of the Millenium Village idea, I thought Carleton was able to fund an entire village, which would make the contribution per student that which is needed to fund the village, which would be satisfying and not arbitrary.  But these villages take millions of dollars per year, so their contribution still was a largely arbitrary amount.  Going back to my previous question, I wonder if there's anything that can be funded which would produce a doable and non-arbitrary contribution...

Though, overall, I think one could get more by requesting more than $6.  Right now, my best guess is the ideal target would be $9, taking advantage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_pricing">psychological pricing</a> -- as compared to, say, asking for $10, which seems a lot higher, though I haven't seen any evidence that psychological pricing happens in philanthropy.  $9 per year would put the individual Denisonian down for $36 in his or her undergraduate career and would raise $19,107 a year.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Is there a way to leverage this for more money?</h4>
One other potential idea I would have is to explore the idea of matching gifts.  Perhaps not only would the students commit to $9/year (or some amount), but the administrators (and perhaps even trustees, staff, faculty, or other people) of the college would also commit to matching the total amount raised by the students this way (or even more, or less, or their own specific amount per year, or something).

This comes from the idea of "challenges" -- For example, a George Washington Trustee <a href="http://www.gwhatchet.com/2012/01/17/trustee-sets-high-bar-for-senior-class-gift/">offered $50,000 if half the class donated</a> to the Senior Class gift.  Getting the administrators/trustees/staff/faculty/other on board along with the students would probably make the idea even more popular and would increase the total size of the gift.

(Note: decision theories are surprisingly not all that helpful at allowing you to make actual decisions in your everyday life.)

A study done over multiple time points showing with cool graphics <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2012/11/04/ideological-bias-and-the-jobs-report/">how conservatives react in a biased manner to political information</a>.  This isn't about conservative-bashing, though, as liberals exhibit the same phenomena under conservative presidents.  It just so happens that this study was done under a liberal president (Obama).

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)">Diplomacy</a> is a strange game where you have a map of World War I Europe and your goal is to capture up to 18 supply centers.  However, each player has the same sized army in the beginning and there are no luck elements.  All you can do is play off each other, forming and breaking alliances.  No one wants to play it because its a really long game (I've heard games can take days to finish), but I want to play it because it sounds like <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/32u/diplomacy_as_a_game_theory_laboratory/">a really exciting way to test game theory</a>.

The correlation between someone being pro-choice on abortion and pro-gay rights <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/08/09/the-myth-of-the-social-issues-the-politics-of-abortion-and-the-politics-of-gay-rights-are-different/">is not as strong as one might think</a>.  Also, pro-life stances are more common among liberals than one might think.

Dictator games, or laboratory tests intended to measure altruism by seeing how much money a participant is willing to split with another person, <a href="http://www.epjournal.net/blog/2013/05/are-all-dictator-game-results-artifacts/">are probably useful only in very specific conditions</a>, because the laboratory is not real life.

				<title>Why It&#039;s Hard to Explain Things: Inferential Distance</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-its-hard-to-explain-things-inferential-distance/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2013 04:00:17 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/?p=359</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some people wonder why it takes so long to explain a point.  Why can't I just explain utilitarianism in a couple of sentences, or just one essay?  Why do they need to read so much?  The answer is because of <i>the problem of large inferential distance</i> which I first encountered in Eliezer Yudkowsky's essay <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_distances">"Expecting Short Inferential Distances"</a>.  I will now, ironically, explain the concept of inferential distance in just one essay.

To start explaining, I begin with an analogy:  Imagine trying to explain to a young-earth creationist why evolution is viewed as so obviously true.  I don't do this to say that you're the obviously wrong creationist and I'm the noble biologist out to explain science to you that you just don't get because you're stupid.  That's not an accurate description of where we stand (nor is it an accurate description of where creationists stand).  It's just a good example to explain my point -- bear with me.<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Anyways, imagine trying to explain to a young-earth creationist why evolution is viewed as so obviously true.

It isn't so easy.  No matter how true evolution is, and how friggin obvious it is to biologists, there just is no one single sentence that would make a young-earth creationist go "Ah ha!  I get it!  I see the error of my ways!  How could I have been so wrong for so long?".  Not even a paragraph can do it, even if it is about something as monumental as how the genetic similarity of animals as confirmed by DNA sequencing clearly creates a neat tree of ancestry.

...Not even a long essay can do it.  ...Not even a few dozen long essays can do it.  ...Not even an entire website <a href="http://talkorigins.org/">TalkOrigins.org</a>, containing over one hundred such long essays in defense of evolution, natural selection, and common descent, including many that from my perspective completely skewer any hope of young-earth creationism being considered a serious position, is able to convince a young-earth creationist to change his or her mind.

We might wonder why this is?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Do We Argue Evolution?</h2>
Many people would hypothesize that such young-earth creationists are "impervious to evidence", "unwilling to see reason", "too stubborn to understand", "too stupid to understand", or <a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2010/07/do-you-care-whether-the-things-you-believe-are-true.html">"not even care about what is true"</a>.  This is perhaps an accurate description of quite many creationists, but not all of them.  And some of the other creationists are impervious/unwilling/stubborn/stupid/uncaring for a reason that they can probably be argued out of, even if only in principle.

In fact, I know an intelligent young earth creationist who is just simply mislead by what evolution is, what the evidence for evolution is, or how evolution functions.  And I think that there is a path to him changing his views, with a lot of argumentation.

But it would take <i>a lot</i> of argumentation: first we would have to debate whether it is circular to believe in the Bible because the Bible says so, then debate why the Bible should not be considered good evidence about biological fact, then debate why we can accept evidence that contradicts the literal Bible, then debate how this evidence should be understood, then debate why we should go with the most likely hypothesis even if we can't be absolutely certain, then debate the scientific method, then debate the age of the earth, then debate what evolution is and entails, then debate why biologists believe in evolution, then debate why each and every of many dozen alleged problems of evolution are fallacious or misleading, then clear up a few philosophical misconceptions, and <i>then</i> we might emerge on the other side with an agreement about evolution.

There's no way to short-cut this.  There's no way that we could get to the bottom of this without perhaps <i>months</i> of discussion.  This is why creationists and biologists don't agree -- it isn't stupidity, it's just so much prerequisite material needs to be cleared up before we can even begin to discuss the merits of evolution as an explanation for the evidence.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Inferential Distance?</h2>
Biologists talking to other biologists can easily justify evolution by saying "it's the simplest explanation" and then providing a few paragraphs of research.  But to the layperson, they have close to no idea what it means for an explanation to be simple, or what biologists look for in explanations, why we should care about whether our explanations are simple, or why being the simplest explanation is enough to conclusively justify a theory.  They might just see "simplest explanation" as a word that is thrown around, like "magnetism" or "conduction".  They don't see the massive amount of concepts bundled into the four word phrase.

On the other hand, it's easy to explain to people why they need to buy a new pair of shoes: both people clearly share the same conception of "shoe" with no disagreement; both people understand clearly that broken shoes are not socially accepted and know what it means for a shoe to be "broken" and what it means to be "socially accepted".  It's obvious to just point to someone "Dude, your shoes are broken, you should buy a new pair".  It's not obvious to just point out to someone "Dude, evolution is the simplest explanation, you should no longer be a creationist".
<p>&nbsp;</p>
This is the idea of <i>inferential distance</i>: in many cases, people don't share the same understanding of concepts or agree in previous lines of argument, and these previous steps need to be addressed before we can get to debate the current step.  Often, there are many such steps, and we end up with the extended debate between the creationist and the biologist.

The <i>size</i> of the inferential distance is thus how many steps need to be discussed before we can get to the matter at hand -- the size is very small between biologists discussing evolution, but quite large between the creationist and biologist.

And thus the <i>problem of large inferential distance</i>: I need to write many essays one-at-a-time and gain agreement on many concepts one at a time before I can even hope to, for example, convince someone why they should become a vegetarian.  The idea of having a reason to be vegetarian sounds not just wrong but outright crazy to some people... that's because, I would argue, the inferential distance.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
My first theory of explanations was taken after Albert Einstein, who famously said "You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother."  I thought that I would just study something so hard that I would truly grasp it, and then come up with a few paragraphs so clear and lucid that anyone who read it would just grasp it immediately.

But inferential distance is a real thing -- there are some positions which are true, but will take months if not years of discussing material to come to understand, <i>even if the process is as efficient and clear as possible</i>.  There's no way out, no short-cut, no get-out-of-inferential-distance-free card.  Those lazy "tl;dr" people just <i>won't learn</i>, and will be left behind forever.

So I suppose Albert Einstein was right.  You indeed don't truly understand something until you can explain it to your grandmother.  But this explanation might take months of discussion, so it probably isn't a practical test of your skills as an explainer or understander.

<h2>But How Can the Distance Be So Large?</h2>
Now that we know about inferential distance, I'd like to end with a discussion of how it got to be so large.  Why do we live in a world where things take years to explain?  This answer is ironically simple and easy to explain: there's been a long history of knowledge, and it's all built upon itself.

It takes a lot to truly understand something, because we've had thousand of years to learn so much.  Back in the times of the Middle Ages, it was easy to understand why the sky is sometimes bluish, because so little was understood about the sky.  It would have been easy to become an expert, if only the sum of human knowledge was so easily communicated via the internet, all else being equal.  But now to get a complete account, you have to learn about how eyes perceive color, how light works, how refraction works, the composure of the atmosphere, and Rayleigh scattering, each of which involve many subconcepts.  Even if you could master one concept in a week, it would take a few months to get it all.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now imagine it for a more complex topic, like morality, cosmology, or artificial intelligence.  It will take years to fully explain it, and there just is no other way to go about it.  The good news is that it can be explained, you can master it, if you try and dedicate your life to it.  The sad truth is that it will take so much time.  There is a sad truth of inferential distance.

We don't just stand on the shoulder of giants, we stand on a long series of giants standing on giants, standing on giants, standing on giants, standing on giants, standing on giants.

And if you don't know what the first giant demonstrated to be true, you will have to start learning all the way from the bottom until you can get to the current field.

				<title>You&#039;re Not Entitled to Your Policy Opinions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm pretty down on the concept of a Presidential "debate", or just how Presidential election marketing works in the first place.  Politics seeks to answer a very important normative question of "how ought the world, or at least our nation, be?".  But in a debate that allocates a whopping two minutes per candidate to settle the enormous question about the role of the government, I don't think due diligence is being done.

But there's a bigger concern.  It's not just that people think that a discussion on the role of government can be done in two minutes, it's that people are so confident about their own opinions on the role of government that they don't notice anything is missing.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Uninformed Voter</h2>
This essay isn't a standard "voters are dumb lol" article, but it's true that voters <i>are</i> notoriously uninformed.  Winston Churchill allegedly said "the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter".  For example, let's take a little quiz.  Without looking up, do you know which political party is the majority party in the House of Representatives?  If so, you're more politically saavy than 37% of the voting population, according to <a href="http://www.electionstudies.org/">National Election Survey data</a>.  (The answer: Republican)

Let's up the ante.  Can you name the Senate Majority Leader?  If so, congratulations.  You're in the top 10% of voters, by political knowledge.  Can you name the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court?  If so, you're in the top 15%, solely by knowing the answer to that question.  (Answers: Harry Reid, John Roberts)  (Though, <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4243">these statistics from ANES may be methodlogically flawed</a>, so take this with a grain of salt.)

And it doesn't just have to be a game of political who's who.  Daniel B. Klein <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/12/i-was-wrong-and-so-are-you/308713/">asks questions like</a> "Does free trade tend to lead to unemployment?" and "Do immigrants reduce the economic well-being of American citizens"?  The answers here also left a lot to be desired.  (Answers: No and no)  Also, <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/11/debate-prep-11-of-americans-grasp-the-ryan-budget/">only 11% of Americans know how much Paul Ryan's budget would cut spending</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Overconfident Voter</h2>
But it's not just that the non-savvy voters get things wrong.  It's that voters -- savvy and non-savvy alike -- both dramatically overestimate how much they know about politics.  Let me explain to you a nonscientific yet apt and hilarious concept referred to "Mount Stupid":

<img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2142_491691737518509_151941220_n.jpg" alt="2142_491691737518509_151941220_n" width="649" height="463" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-388" />

I'd add to Mount Stupid nearly every discussion I've ever had on how the economy works.

I think some people underestimate how scientific economics can be, and how much is actually known about the economy.  For instance, check out <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel">The IGM Forum of Economic Experts</a>, a representative sample of economists -- there is very broad agreement on <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_5hFa4fmjPDXbnww">long run US fiscal responsibility requiring either tax increases or Medicare/Medicaid cuts</a>, that <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_6WobHKFEZbGbS84">gasoline prices are largely unaffected by US economic policy</a>, <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_a4WFSSCbjqpjWW8">the bank bailout reduced unemployment</a>, <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_cw5O9LNJL1oz4Xi">the stimulus bill reduced unemployment</a>, <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_cw1nNUYOXSAKwrq">a return to the Gold Standard would not create price stability</a>, and that <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_9Rezb430SESUA4Y">a carbon tax would be a more cost-effective way of reducing emissions than fuel standards</a>.

But obviously there is little consensus on what combination of tax increases/cuts and government spending increases/decreases are optimal, especially given that there are many different types of taxes and many different programs where spending should be increased or decreased.  My personal study has led me to slant toward <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics">Keynesian economics</a>, but I still wouldn't put much confidence in it.  And if you've never heard of the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_multiplier">"tax multiplier"</a> or don't know what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowding_out_(economics)">"crowding out"</a> means, chances are strong that you don't know enough to be confident in your economic opinions either.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Where Does Good Policy Come From?</h2>
As I said, I'm interested in the question "how ought the world, or at least our nation, be?"  I interpret this via a <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-utilitarianism/">utilitarian</a> standpoint, seeking to maximize global welfare with the best possible policy positions.  But what are those positions?  Obama doesn't know.  Romney doesn't know.  Ron Paul doesn't know.  The economists definitely don't know for sure, though they do have fairly good guesses.  And I certainly don't, knowing much less than all of them about how the economy works.

But there is the big problem.  Recall the Presidential debate, or really any debate on politics.  At the end, it's never about who "won" the debate in the sense of being the most accurate or the most reasonable.  Instead, it's all about who "won" the debate in the sense of appearing the most confident and being the most persuasive to people (including me) who really don't know any better, all things considered.  The way political rhetoric is used, you'd think that there isn't any room for those interested in seeking out optimal policy positions and avoiding overconfidence.  Rather, politics is dominated by those convinced they already have the solution.

But creating good policy cannot be like that.  As Holden Karnofsky <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2007/09/25/politics-2/">explains well</a>:

<blockquote>[If] I want to form a theory (about, say, how to close the achievement gap)[, I] read what others have already done to test the theory; revise my theory; then try my theory out on a small scale; test it; revise it again. [The overconfident] are sure they already know how to close the achievement gap (they generally, though not always, inherit their solution from their party), and spend all their time fighting to get their idea implemented across the whole nation, which is of course a battle that takes decades and leaves no room for testing or learning about their solution. [...]

Yes, there are some issues that I think are clear-cut, and I respect the people that fight for the right side. But I wish more people would step back and say, "Helping people is hard, not easy. My guess at how to do it is a guess, not a divine truth opposed only by evil people and the dupes who listen to them."  There are evil people and interest groups on every issue, but even if we struck them down, we’d be left with the question of what to do. That’s the question I’m interested in.</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Take It Down a Notch, For America</h2>
They say everyone is entitled to their own opinions, just not their own facts.  I'm not even sure people are entitled to their own opinions.  In so far as opinions are supposed to reflect facts (which I hope they are), then any strong confidence in your policy opinions is probably not deserved.

I don't say all this to denigrate your intelligence, or to suggest that I'm somehow superior to you, or that we're both superior to the average voter.  It's not just that people could stand to know more; though they should.  It's that even the economists don't know the answers here, so people need to stop pretending to know what they don't, even if it's "just an opinion".

All I ask is that if you have large amounts of confidence in policy opinions -- if you have strong feelings that tax cuts/increases are the way to go, that spending cuts/increases are what we need, that the budget deficit is our biggest concern/not a worry -- take all of these feelings and think carefully about what you really know.  Do you really deserve to have such strong opinions?  Does anyone, based on how well these problems are actually understood?

The one and only thing I'm confident in when it comes to policy opinions is that the answer is no.  We're not entitled to our own policy opinions, and we need to take a whole new level of humility to them.  ...A level of humility that is sadly not seen in politics much at all.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Looking around at the way philanthropy has been presented in various articles, books, and conference speeches, I keep noticing two different approaches to social change:

<b>The "Just Do It!" Approach:</b> In this approach, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.  So why not take a bunch of shots at once, learn from the failures, get up, and try to do it again?  This approach has the catchphrase <b>"innovation"</b> and it emphasizes lofty goals (end world hunger now!), trial-and-error, and going big or going home.  I see this approach being personified by an organization like <a href="http://befearless.casefoundation.org/">"The Case Foundation"</a>, or in an article like <a href="http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/its_time_to_be_fearless">"It's Time to Be Fearless"</a>.

<b>The "Study Everything Before Doing Anything" Approach:</b> In this approach, you have to look both ways before crossing the street.  You can't just run off and expect to solve the social problem without putting in a bunch of time to understand it first.  This approach has the catchphrase <b>"measurement"</b> and emphasizes academia, careful analysis, and spending a lot of time thinking before rolling out some specifically targeted action.  I see this approach being personified by an organization like <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, or in an article like <a href="http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/six_theory_of_change_pitfalls_to_avoid">"Six Theories of Change Pitfalls to Avoid"</a>.<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Philanthropy Battlefield</h2>
Of course, these approaches are intentional exaggerations, and many non-profit organizations fall on a sliding-scale somewhere between both -- no organization actually devotes their entire efforts to doing things at random with no sense of what they're doing or why or at least some semblance of whether it's working, and no organization actually does nothing but think about what they could be doing.

Yet, when I see these approaches mentioned, it seems to be in a head-to-head competition, and it keeps feeling like I have to go with one or the other.  Either I'm a fearless "Just Do It!"-er who is going to go out there, found my own non-profit, and make history with a big leap, or I'm a stuffy "Study Everything Before Doing Anything"-er, doomed to spend the rest of my non-profit life in a library looking up complex academic articles on JSTOR about development economics.

If I'm advocating for better measurement or careful planning, it automatically means I can't be doing or innovating.  Likewise, if I'm advocating for not sitting around and waiting, it automatically means I can't be measuring or planning.

I'm here to tell you that it doesn't <i>have</i> to be an either-or approach.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Two Approaches?  Take 'Em Both!</h2>
<b>First, we really need both approaches to be operating at once.</b>  We need people out there who are doing some trial-and-error and working on being cutting-edge in the actual field, where the people actually are, getting them the services that are already known to work, or trying out new innovative ideas and seeing if they work.  If it wasn't for the "Just Do It!"-ers, nothing would actually get done.  We'd be studying forever.

At the same time, we need careful planners to test the ideas of the innovators more robustly and scientifically, so that we don't trick ourselves into thinking that something works when it doesn't.  We need the measurers to see if the innovations are actually working, and not just wastes of time and money.  If it wasn't for the "Study Everything Before Doing Anything"-ers, we'd have no idea if things were being done well.  We'd be inefficient and wasteful.

The two approaches also feed into each other.  The "Just Do It!"-ers on the field provide valuable data for the "Study Everything Before Doing Anything"-ers to test and analyze.  The "Study Everything Before Doing Anything"-ers in the labs provide valuable direction for the "Just Do It!"-ers to focus on doing things more likely to work and avoiding previous mistakes.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Two Approaches?  Combine 'Em!</h2>
<b>Second, we really need to avoid the extremes.</b>  An approach with absolutely zero thought, planning, or testing behind it (the stereotypical "Just Do It!"-er) is going to be overwhelmingly likely doomed to fail.  The problems that plague us are enormously complex -- too hard for someone to just jump out and fix in one swoop.  There are too many potential solutions to try and far few solutions actually work well.  Recall that interventions <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">can differ in effectiveness by a factor of 1000</a>.  Worse yet, a lot of popular initatives end up harming the people they plan to help.  If you choose to do something without thinking, not only could you end up doing something much less effective than you otherwise could, but you could end up just hurting others.

Yet, an approach with absolutely zero action behind it doesn't get anything done (the stereotypical "Study Everything Before Doing Anything"-er).  You need action to actually do things for people -- lots of thinking about what could be done and what could be the most effective thing to do means absolutely nothing to the people in need unless the most effective thing to do actually moves on from "to do" to "to <i>done</i>".  If you choose to study without having any plans to turn this into action somewhere down the road, you're just sitting on the sidelines, totally removed from actually helping.

Thus no initiative to help people can be done totally one way or the other.  <b>If you actually want to help people, you need to both study AND do.</b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Matters And Why</h2>
<b>So leaping doesn't mean you can't look first.  But at the same time, looking doesn't mean you can't leap.</b>

The solution is to see these two approaches not as natural enemies, but natural allies.  Stereotypical "Just Do It!"-ers have a lot to learn about avoiding common mistakes that have been done in the past, so they're not doomed to repeat them.  They have a lot to learn about becoming more successful through doing the only thing that can let you know if you're successful -- actual measurement.

Likewise, stereotypical "Study Everything Before Doing Anything"-ers have a lot to learn about trial-and-error.  Often, the best data comes from trying a bunch of different solutions and seeing which ones work.  You can't be allergic to failure, because failure is a good teacher too.  You do need to actually leverage your work into success.

We need people working on both doing and studying, and we need coordination so that the doing is informed by the studying and the studying is useful for the doing.  Likewise, we need money and work going into proven, effective interventions and testing up-and-coming innovation to see if it's as effective at solving the problem.  With people's lives on the line, we can't afford to fail in a way we can't study and learn from, and we can't afford to let studying go to waste without actually improving the way we do.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/resolutions-update-june-edition">"Resolutions Update: June Edition"</a>.</i>

About half a year ago, I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions">outlined some New Years Resolutions</a>, and then did what I thought impossible -- used the power of blogging, precommitment, and betting to <i>actually stick to my plans</i>.  Following up <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/resolutions-update-june-edition/">my last report in June</a>, I present my July update, where I see how I'm doing against my goals, and... more importantly... <i>update</i> my goals based on how things are going so far.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How the New System Worked</h2>
Last month, I switched from tracking all of my goals individually to tracking them in a total points system, and then scoring the month as a whole for the points needed.  This system offered the ability to fail in one area and make up for it by overworking another area, or fail on one day and make up for it by overworking another day, which has it's share of pros and cons.  Here's how things broke down.

<b>Points:</b> My system required scoring 10800 points for the month, which averages to 360 points a day.  I succeeded at this, accruing 11670 points for the month.  The averaging worked nicely, because I had a high of 613 points and a low of 225 points.

<b>Exercise:</b> I exercised 16 out of the 30 days of June, averaging 23 minutes of strenuous exercise per day.  I also walked an average of 38 minutes a day.  I had a noticeable relapse in running ability after not running for awhile in the beginning of the month, followed by a very noticeable recovery to where I was in ability at the end of May.  I also had noticeable gains in strength.  Overall, I'm reassured that despite not trying to exercise or walk for particular amounts of time (walking itself varied wildly from between nothing to <i>five hours</i> per day!), they ended up very close to what I had wanted (about 20 minutes of strenuous exercise and 40 minutes of walking).

<b>Diet:</b> I had a few different goals for diet.  The first was to consume 2.5L water a day.  I fell a bit short, consuming closer to 2L a day.  The second was to consume >56g of protein.  This went very well, with most days involving >100g of protein.  Thirdly, I wanted to eat one fruit and one vegetable a day, which I succeeded at about 70% of the time.  Additionally, I still greatly increased the amount of vitamins and minerals I was getting, despite not tracking those officially.  Lastly, I wanted to eat less than 2174kcal each day.  That went less well -- I only succeeded 47% of the time.  Overall, I think my system needs to be stricter on diet.

<b>Weight:</b> On 3 June, I weighed 181lbs, down from the 210lbs I started back in January.  On the 1 July, I weighed in at 181lbs.  Therefore, I maintained my weight.  My plan was to lose 4lbs for the month, but making sure to get less than 2100 Calories proved difficult.  Additionally, one should note the margin of error in weight.

<b>Productivity:</b>  This month, I spent an average of 6 and a half hours a day working on "tasks", 50 minutes a day "writing", 7 hours a day with friends and family, and 30 minutes a day researching (previously called "targeted reading").  Note that sometimes these overlap, like working on tasks with a friend.  I think this is pretty ideal for a summer month where I'm home specifically to make time for friends and family.

<b>Hygiene:</b> I'm sure you don't want the actual details on this one, but things are continuing to improve.

<b>Annual Goals:</b> My three goals outside this system and my <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-strategic-plan/">strategic plan</a> are to (1) write 200 blog essays, (2) add four games to the arcade, and (3) get my driver's license.  Overall, I've now written 97/200 essays (49% in 50% of the time), done no more work on the games, and am significantly closer to getting my license.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tweaking the System</h2>
So how am I going to change this system going forward for July?

<b>Reconsidering what counts as a "task":</b> I decided there was little point to "punish" writing and researching by making them count for less points, so now they will be categorized with tasks and counted for 15 points per half hour.

<b>Adding more hygiene:</b> To further clean myself and my surroundings, I'm adding making my bed, using mouthwash, and shaving to the list of things to do, for +10 points each.

<b>Increasing points for important activities:</b> Exercising will now be worth 25 points (was 20) and can be claimed six days a week instead of five.  Showering is now worth 20 points (was 15) and brushing teeth is now worth 20 points (was 10).

<b>Adding keeping up daily logs:</b> It will now be worth 20 points to make sure I update all my logs for the day.

<b>New nutrition goals:</b> I've decided that I've spent enough time doing meal-by-meal tracking on <a href="http://www.cronometer.com">Cronometer</a> that I'm just going to make my own diet goals.  On this system, I'll get 20 points for drinking 5 cups of water, 20 points for drinking 5 cups of milk, 20 points for eating a protein bar, and -10 points for each bag of chips, sweet, or other clearly unhealthy thing I eat.

<b>New sleeping goals:</b> Over the past month, I've tried my hand at <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/siesta/">biphasic sleep</a>, which is a fancy way to say "sleep less at night and make up for it with a nap".  My current plan is to try sleeping for six hours during the night (usually around 1-7am) and then nap half an hour during the day (usually around 4:30-5pm).  To re-enforce this, I'll give myself 20 points for sleeping 7 hours in a day or less.

<b>New point demand:</b> Earlier, I required 360 points per day from myself, averaged over the month.  I had an average of 389, but now there are more points to earn, so my guess is if I put in the same effort under the new system, I can average 444 points a day.  To ramp things up a bit, I'm going to demand 460 points a day from myself for the month of July and see how I do.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi peter

I visit your blog frok time to time after I found it in a less wrong post . You have a great blog.

I liked the way you used points for your goals. I think that is a great way to motivate yourself . I might try it for some projects I am planning to do in the near future.

I have read your updates for July, June, May and April. I will comeback later to finish the other updates and I think they might inspire me or give me some ideas that I can use.

Keep on the good job, and I will follow your goals and wish you the best of luck .

				<title>The Worst Way of Picking the Worst Charities</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/the-worst-way-of-picking-the-worst-charities/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/">The Tampa Bay Times</a> and the <a href="http://cironline.org/">Center for Investigative Reporting</a> teamed up and published a list of <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/americas-worst-charities/">America's Worst Charities</a>.  Here, they ranked non-profit organizations by the amount of money they paid solicitors, or fundraisers, and the amount those fundraisers returned.  They mention that "watchdog groups say no more than 35 percent of donations should go to fundraising costs" and suggest that these organizations are basically nothing more than scams designed to get fundraisers rich.

Perhaps these charities listed here actually are some of the worst.  Perhaps they're even outright scams.  However, the amount of money they spend on fundraising isn't going to let you know whether the organization is one not worth your donations.  The CEOs of <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/">GuideStar</a>, <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/">Charity Navigator</a>, and the <a href="http://www.bbb.org/us/charity/">BBC Wise Giving Alliance</a> -- three organizations that regularly rank non-profits -- came together and wrote a <a href="http://overheadmyth.com/letter-to-the-donors-of-america/">"Letter to the Donors of America"</a> that states "The percent of charity expenses that go to administrative and fundraising costs—commonly referred to as 'overhead' — is a poor measure of a charity’s performance."<!--more-->

Actually, focusing exclusively on the amount of fundraising when considering how bad a non-profit is is actually very dangerous to philanthropy.  Why?  As Dan Pallotta mentions in his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfAzi6D5FpM">TED Talk</a> entitled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfAzi6D5FpM">"The Way We Think About Charity is Dead Wrong"</a>, non-profits need to spend money on overhead to grow and expand.  Organizations need to spend money on fundraising in order to spread awareness and get more people to contribute to their organization.

For example, consider a for-profit car company.  When they get money in from sales, they don't spend all of it to immediately produce new cars.  Instead, they spend money on advertising, market research, safety research, testing, etc.  Yet, in the world of non-profits, all of this is labeled "overhead" and demonized.  If a non-profit could take $1 million that it raised and re-invest it in fundraising to get $10 million, then they've grown a lot as an organization and can now afford to help many more people than it could before.  Yet, non-profits frequently don't do this, because donors see it as a negative thing.  Therefore, the way we think about charity has to change.

As the "Letter to the Donors of America" says, "In fact, many charities should spend more on overhead.  Overhead costs include important investments charities make to improve their work. [...] These expenses allow a charity to sustain itself (the way a family has to pay the electric bill) or to improve itself (the way a family might invest in college tuition)."

<p>&nbsp;</p>
So when we want to decide if a charity is good or not, what should we focus on instead?  The CEOs of Guidestar, Charity Navigator, and the Wise Giving Alliance suggest focusing on "transparency, governance, leadership, and results".  I agree.  What really matters is a non-profit you can trust to get things done.  For example, would you rather have a non-profit that takes your $100 donation, uses it to raise $1000, and then help ten people?  Or would you rather have a non-profit that takes your $100 donation and only ends up helping one person?

Or would you rather have a non-profit that is just more cost-effective, able to help one hundred people on $100 instead of $1000?  Or, the best of both worlds, an organization that takes your $100, raises $1000, and then helps 1000 people?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Sure, those on the list of <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/americas-worst-charities/">America's Worst Charities</a> aren't getting much out of their fundraising budgets.  But other organizations -- the ones that get results -- do.  And they provide you the opportunity to get a lot of bang for your buck.

We should focus our efforts on figuring out which organizations are capable of being effective and support them, no matter how much they fundraise or spend on other overhead costs.

				<title>Sunday Links #8: Immigration</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Immigration is in the news with the new reform bill, so I thought it was worthwhile to highlight why I've changed my mind from "don't care much about immigration" to "definitely in favor of making immigration easier".  It turns out that immigration (1) improves the quality of life of the immigrants themselves and (2) improves the quality of life of the immigrants' home families and communities.  These two parts alone make it worth the net cost to the host country, in my opinion.

...But wait, you say?  There actually isn't a "net cost to the host country" because immigration is a "win-win"?  Yes!  Turns out that all the people afraid of "Mexican immigrants stealin' our dang jobs" were wrong, because immigration also (3) creates economic growth in the country they immigrate to.  It turns out that the desire to build a large fence between US and Mexico, perhaps <a href="thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/cain-proposes-electrified-border-fence/">even with an "alligator-filled moat" and "topped with electrified barbed wire"</a>, pretty much couldn't be any more terrible...<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Improving the Life of the Immigrants and their Families</h2>
Julia Wise highlights in <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/02/your-huddled-masses-yearning-to-breathe.html">Your Huddled Masses Yearning to Breathe Free</a> that "[y]oung people move to rich countries, get jobs that pay far better than they could make back home in India or Mexico, and send some of their earnings back home to their families.  That money amounts to more than twice the global aid to developing countries."

Shaun Raviv, writing for Giving What We Can, concurs, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2012-12-07/migration-as-a-possible-way-of-helping-the-poor">suggesting that</a> funding migration could even be an effective way to help the poor: "Moving a person to a country that is better organized and makes use of more advanced technology can increase their economic productivity many times over. Reflecting this, the same taxi driver in Swaziland earns multiples of her previous income if she can do the same job in Switzerland. This is a faster and larger financial impact than that offered by any other health, education, or economic empowerment program I know of."

GiveWell <a href="http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Michael%20Clemens%20Notes%2002-20-13%20public.pdf">spoke with Michael Clemens</a> [PDF], an economist who studies the relationship between migration and development, who concludes that "[i]ncreased labor mobility as an excellent mechanism for increasing developing world citizens' incomes".

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Net Benefit to the Host Country</h2>
There is certainly some cost to immigration.  A 2007 US Congressional Budget Office review of 29 reports <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/87xx/doc8711/12-6-immigration.pdf">found that</a> while they can't make a conclusion about the aggregate effect across all US states, generally state and local governments incur "minor" and "modest" costs from providing services to illegal immigrants that is not compensated for by increased tax revenue.

Overall, the potential for economic gain from decreasing barriers to emigration/immigration is huge -- something Michael Clemens calls <a href="http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.25.3.83">"trillion dollar bills on the sidewalk"</a> [PDF].  As Clemens explains, lots of people want to emigrate and cannot because of existing political barriers.  But, if they could, he estimates large gains for world GDP.  As he states, "How large are the economic losses caused by barriers to emigration?  Research on this question has been distinguished by its rarity and obscurity, but the few estimates we have should make economists’ jaws hit their desks."

Indeed, instead of "take our jobs", immigrants add more jobs through increasing demand.  An <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/docs/Hinojosa%20-%20Raising%20the%20Floor%20for%20American%20Workers%20010710.pdf">Immigration Policy Center report</a> concludes "[c]omprehensive immigration reform generates an increase in U.S. GDP of at least 0.84 percent. Summed over 10 years, this amounts to a cumulative $1.5 trillion in additional  GDP. It also boosts wages for both native-born and newly legalized immigrant workers" and that "[m]ass deportation reduces U.S. GDP by 1.46 percent. This amounts to $2.6 trillion in cumulative lost GDP over 10 years, not including the actual cost of deportation."
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/docs/Hinojosa%20-%20Raising%20the%20Floor%20for%20American%20Workers%20010710.pdf">The Migration Policy Institute agrees</a>: "In the long run, immigrants do not reduce native employment rates, but they do increase productivity and hence average income.  This finding is consistent with the broad existing literature on the impact of immigration in the United States. [...I]mmigration unambiguously improves employment, productivity, and income".

<a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/09-013_15702a45-fbc3-44d7-be52-477123ee58d0.pdf">A Harvard Business Review survey of the literature finds</a> "immigration does not exert significant effects on native labor market outcomes" and "[ev]ven large, sudden infows of immigrants were not found to reduce native wages or employment significantly".

TIME also review the literature in <a href="http://business.time.com/2013/01/30/the-economics-of-immigration-who-wins-who-loses-and-why/">"The Economics of Immigration: Who Wins, Who Loses, and Why"</a> and concludes that pretty much everyone wins, with the exception of low-income native workers, where the literature is split on whether they are negatively impacted or not.

Moreover, the IGM Forum Panel of Economists finds <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_0JtSLKwzqNSfrAF">95% of economists agree</a> that "[t]he average US citizen would be better off if a larger number of highly educated foreign workers were legally allowed to immigrate to the US each year."
<p>&nbsp;</p>
At this point, it becomes tiring to continue to cite the tremendous amount of economic literature and experts pointing in favor of increased immigration as a benefit to the host country, so I'll just leave a few links here: CNBC on <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100449802">"Immigration Reform: Good or Bad for the Economy?"</a> (Answer: Yes), <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/EconomicEffectsCitizenship-1.pdf">"The Economic Effects of Granting Legal Status and Citizenship to Undocumented Immigrants"</a> [PDF] (Answer: The effects are positive for both natives and immigrants), <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1542-4774.2011.01052.x/abstract">"Rethinking the Effect of Immigration on Wages"</a> (Answer: immigration increases wages for pretty much everyone), <a href="http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/app.1.3.135">"Task Specialization, Immigration, and Wages"</a> (Answer: there is little negative effect on wages from immigration as long as immigrants specialize in different tasks than natives), <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v79y1997i4p594-604.html">"Employment Effects Of Immigration To Germany: An Analysis Based On Local Labor Markets"</a> (Answer: No negative effects on natives wages), <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ecorec/v78y2002i240p68-78.html">"The Impact of Immigration on the Earnings of Natives: Evidence from Australian Micro Data"</a> (Answer: No negative effects on natives wages), and...

...I actually have about <i>fifty</i> more citations, but I think you get the point.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>But Why?</h2>
Why might this be the case?

Robert Wiblin says in <a href="http://robertwiblin.com/2009/10/18/immigrants-dont-steal-your-jobs-any-more-than-your-own-children-do/">"Immigrants Don’t Steal Your Jobs Any More Than Your Own Children Do" that </a>:</b> "Reviewing the literature on the impact of immigrants on the economy, I’ve been impressed by the unanimity on the empirical question of whether immigrants increase unemployment or reduce wages in the receiving country. [...] These results are interesting only because the myth that immigrants ‘take jobs’ is so widespread. It is a peculiar myth – why would new people reduce the pool of productive jobs available? All countries have doubled their populations many times over due to childbirth and they never run out of productive work to do because there is no limited pool of work to be divided up."

Heck, even William Easterly, noted foreign aid skeptic, <a href="http://aidwatchers.com/2010/02/twofer-here%E2%80%99s-how-haitians-can-rescue-the-us-from-its-budget-crisis-and-save-themselves/">is excited about this:</a> "If you are worried about having enough tax revenue to pay interest on the government debt, find more taxpayers! And look, here are some people volunteering to become new taxpayers: Haitian immigrants fleeing quakes and poverty! So let’s open the door to our Haitian fiscal rescuers, who will also lift themselves out of poverty[. ...] It’s a TWOFER!"]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Want to be happier than you already are?  Many people look to self-help books as a way to become happy.  Sometimes they give good advice and sometimes they dont.  However, one of the most robust, enduring findings from psychological studies of increasing people's happiness has been that happiness can be found from journaling, especially when you keep a regular journal of what you're grateful for.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Gratitude</h2>
Gratitude is defined as the reliable emotional response that one has to receiving benefits<sup>1</sup>.  Gratitude is also known to correlate with subjective levels of happiness<sup>1,2,3,4,5</sup>, as well as pro-social behavior, self-efficacy, and self-worth<sup>6,7</sup>.  Moreover, this connection with happiness is found in both student and nonstudent populations, and persists even when controlling for extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness<sup>8,9</sup>.  Gratitude also fights stress, materialism, and negative self-comparisons<sup>7</sup>.

But what if you're not already grateful?  Well, there is a solution.  Regular practice of gratitude has theological origins -- Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, all consider it a virtue and prescribe approaches for practicing<sup>10</sup>.

And it appears that religion is right on this one -- gratitude can be trained, and one way to do so is the gratitude journal.  And by training in gratitude, one can become lastingly happier.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Writing as a Cure</h2>
Studies have found that while talking about one's problems doesn't help one to feel better about them, even if it seems like the talk helped at the time<sup>11</sup>, writing about the problem does help.  In one study, participants who had been recently laid off from work were asked to spend a few minutes each day writing a diary about their feelings regarding the lay off.  Doing so produced boosts in happiness, self-esteem, health, and psychological and physical well-being<sup>12</sup>.  Other similar studies found similar results<sup>13</sup>.

But one doesn't need trauma in order to get these beneficial results.  Another study had people assigned to write for 20 minutes a day for four days about one of four topics at random -- either a traumatic life event, their best possible future self, both, or a nonemotional control.  A follow up five months later found that writing about <i>either</i> trauma <i>or</i> a positive future lead to reduced illness and increased subjective well-being compared to controls, though writing about trauma induced a short-term negative mood<sup>14</sup>.  Another follow up study found that reduced illness and increased subjective well-being resulted even from writing about intensely <i>positive</i> events<sup>15</sup>.

Affectionate writing is another type of regular journaling, where you write in your journal about affection for friends, family, or romantic partners.  This too has been found to have beneficial effects, such as lower cholesterol<sup>16</sup>.  Another study involved writing a letter of affection to someone and personally delivering it to them, which was found to decrease depressive symptoms for a few months<sup>17</sup>, but then had no further longer-term effects.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Gratitude Journal</h2>
But suppose you're not recovering from a recent serious problem, but instead just want to boost your happiness in your everyday life.  What should you do?  Instead, you can get the same benefit of journaling by focusing on gratitude.

In another study, three groups of college students were asked to keep short, daily diaries -- one group would write about what they were grateful for in that day, the second group would write about what annoyed them, and the third group was asked just to keep track of events from a neutral perspective.

Those who kept careful track of what they were grateful for were more happy, more optimistic, and healthier than the other two groups at the end of the study<sup>18</sup> after two weeks of journaling and a three-week follow up period.  This study was then replicated among another college population<sup>19</sup> and replicated a third time among college populations<sup>17</sup>.  Researchers also tested the theory beyond college students -- in middle school classrooms<sup>20</sup>, among adults with neuromuscular disease<sup>18</sup>, and among Korean healthcare professionals<sup>21</sup>.  Each time, they found that gratitude journaling produced reliable increases in happiness.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
So what should we do if we want to start a gratitude journal?  Well, get a journal and start writing!  I've been <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/gratitude-journal/">keeping mine on my blog</a>, but you could keep your wherever you like.  However, here are some tips to make the implementation better:

<b>It won't work for everyone.</b>  These effects only appear in the aggregate.  So far, little research has been done to find moderating effects of gratitude journaling, but it is known to work better for women than for men, though it still works for men just fine<sup>4,5,7</sup>.  It's possible that journaling won't work for certain people.  <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/9v/beware_of_otheroptimizing/">Beware of other-optimizing</a>.

<b>It won't work if it annoys you.</b> If you find the journaling tedious or annoying, you'll lose the happiness boost<sup>19</sup>, so it's important you find some way to keep it fresh.  In one experiment, college students were assigned to do a gratitude journal either daily or once a week.  While both groups showed a boost, the once-a-week group actually found a higher boost in happiness<sup>19</sup>, presumably because they didn't get bored with the journal.

<b>Thinking about the subtraction of positive events produces an even bigger boost.</b>  While one gains a boost in happiness from reflecting on being grateful for, say, wildflowers, one can get an even higher boost in happiness if instructed to <i>also</i> try and imagine a world where wildflowers don't exist<sup>7</sup>.

<b>Think about what caused these good events.</b> Thinking not just about what you're grateful for but why things turned out the way they did to inspire gratitude also had better effects<sup>17</sup>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
It's not all that often that science hands us a definitive self-help practice that has been this well vetted.  Maybe it works for you; maybe it doesn't.  Maybe it's worth your time; maybe you are happy enough that you can forgo the effort.  But it's hopefully at least worth thinking about.

After all, I'm grateful that positive psychology exists.

<blockquote>are there studies examining the effects of keeping a gratitude journal for prolonged periods of time?</blockquote>

I think the longest time frame tested was six weeks, but I'd have to go through the studies again.  There's no requirement that you be grateful for a different thing every time, though.

<blockquote>What has been your experience so far?</blockquote>

It had a minor increase on my happiness for about two weeks (though my happiness is already really high) and then it started annoying me that I had to complete it daily, so I switched it to weekly.

Moving to Oxford has left me a little homesick, so I'm interested to see if reflecting on gratefulness here will make me less homesick.]]></wp:comment_content>

For example, the landmark gratitude study Positive Psychology Progress found happiness continued to increase, even after six months. I'm working off of memory here... I believe the participants were only asked to keep a gratitude journal for a few weeks, but most continued on their own. 

Anyhow, there are a number of studies which have looked back months or years later, after the study has ended. I think the longest is two years.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I enjoyed all the research you have done to show the true benefits of developing a gratitude habit.  I write and take pictures of moments I am grateful for on my blog. I invite everyone visiting my blog to share what they are thankful for in the comments. This practice really helps you focus on what you value, and makes you realize that everyday, no matter what happens, there is always something to be grateful for. I have found that this makes me live everyday to the fullest so when you practice gratitude it actually gets easier to come up with a daily gratitude list!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm sure this stuff is somewhat useful for some people, but let's not forget that unhappiness is often directly man-made, in a very material sense. No amount of self-help can compare to something as mundane as a stable currency, enough food or the mere absence of physical violence.

As for "gratitude", remember that human societies are mostly coercive constructions making people do things against their will. We are born without consent, but countless obligations and not really much of a say in the matter. We don't even have the right to freely buy reliable painless suicide pills to opt out of these societies, which speaks volumes. Not to mention nonhuman animals who are literally being tortured, i.e. painful castration, as you well know.

I think I'll reserve my gratitude for a time when we're no longer effectively at war with each other. But then the effect would be a rounding error anyway.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Peter, are there studies examining the effects of keeping a gratitude journal for prolonged periods of time?  My fear is that, after a while, you may run out of things to be grateful for.  Once this happens, sticking to the diary might backfire, if it creates the impression that your life is devoid of valuable things.  What has been your experience so far?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past month, I've tried my hand at <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/siesta/">biphasic sleep</a>, which is a fancy way to say "sleep less at night and make up for it with a nap".  My current plan is to try sleeping for six hours during the night (usually around midnight to 6am or 6:30am) and then nap twenty minutes during the day (usually around 1-1:30pm), though this has changed a lot over time.

Here, I provide a day-by-day log on how things are going.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jun">June 2013</h2>
<b>3 June:</b> Slept 1:45-8:45a [7hrs].  This is normal for my monophonic sleep and is mostly sustainable.  I usually sleep about 51 hours a week when on a disciplined, monophonic sleep schedule.

<b>4 June:</b> Decided to start biphasic sleep.  Slept from 2-7:30a [5.5hrs].  Woke up very tired, but after having my alarm across the room and drinking water immediately after turning off the alarm, I felt awake like normal.  I had coffee at 8a.  At around 7p I started feeling tired, so at 7:30p I set an alarm to take a 90 minute nap.  I woke up after 60 minutes.

<b>5 June:</b> Went to sleep at 2:30a and woke up naturally at 6:30a [4hrs] feeling rested.  Decided this was too little sleep and went back to sleep until 7:30a [5hrs].  Woke up feeling very tired and went back to sleep until 7:45a [total sleep 5.25hrs].  Woke up again very tired, but after having alarm across the room / drinking water, I felt awake like normal.  I felt pretty sleepy again at 3p, but this might be because I was at a boring presentation.  At around 3:30p I started waking up again and felt like normal.  I started getting sleepy again around 8p and tried to nap in the car (from Cleveland to Columbus) at 8:30p, but I didn't fall asleep.  I wasn't able to take a nap at the time I wanted, and felt very sleepy around 11p.  I tried to take a 1hr nap at 11:30p, but I drifted off to sleep until 7a the next morning.

<b>6 June:</b> Woke up at 5:30a [6.5hrs] naturally and felt moderately alert, but felt like it was too early, and I went back to sleep.  Woke up again at 6:30a [7hrs] and felt sleepy, so I went back to sleep.  Woke up again at 7a naturally [7.5hrs].  Felt a bit more tired than usual during the morning.  Felt better after I drank water, but felt a bit sleepy again in an hour.  Went for a run that was more sluggish than usual.  Came back feeling alert and felt alert for the rest of the day.

<b>7 June:</b> Slept 12:30-6a [5.5hrs].  Woke up via alarm in the middle of a dream and what felt like a pretty deep sleep.  I didn't wake up feeling all that sleepy, and after getting the alarm across the room and drinking some water, I felt totally fine.  Morning activities felt about as sluggish as yesterday morning's, however, but picked up after going on a walk and taking a lukewarm shower.  The remainder of the day, I felt alert, and felt unusually more effective, productive, and creative.  However, I also felt more grouchy.  I tried to nap 6:30-7p, but two annoyingly spaced phone calls prevented me from falling asleep, though I do recall dreaming.  I started to get tired around 11:45a.

<b>8 June:</b> Slept at 12:45a.  Had my alarm set for 6a, but it either didn't go off, I didn't hear it, or I unconsciously woke up and turned the alarm off (it wasn't far enough away from my bed like it should be).  I continued to sleep until waking up naturally at 9a [8.25hrs], feeling more tired in the morning than in the past couple of mornings.  Felt better after eating breakfast.  Remained alert until 6p, when I got tired.  I took a nap from 6:30 to 7p.  Still felt tired and continued to nap until 7:30p.  Felt alert for the rest of the day.

<b>9 June:</b> Started getting really tired around 1:30a, after completing my bodyweight exercise.  I went to bed at 2a and woke up by alarm at 7a [5hrs], but felt tired and didn't feel motivated enough to want to try and become awake, even though I felt like I could.  So I slept in until 8a [6hrs], and then 8:15a [6.25hrs].  I woke up feeling rather tired still, but while reading, I gradually woke up and felt alert by 9a.  I felt a little sleepy at both 1:30p and 4:15p (both times in a car), but felt alert otherwise, especially after doing bodyweight exercises.

<b>10 June:</b> Started getting tired around 1a, and I went to bed at 1:30a, with my plan to have the alarm far away and some water to drink.  I set the alarm for 6:30a [5hrs].  I woke up at 8a [6.5hrs] with the alarm in my hand.  I felt tired, so I decided to sleep in to 9a [7.5hrs].  I'm confused as to why waking up worked out really well in the beginning, but then stopped working.  I woke up feeling alert, though, and continued to feel alert until around 10p, when I felt sleepy until about midnight.

<b>11 June:</b> Got tired around 1a, and I went to bed at 1:30a.  Woke up at 7a [5.5hrs], decided this was too early, and went back to sleep and woke up at 7:30a [6hrs].  Felt tired for a bit, drank some water, and by the time I had clothes on and was downstairs, I felt wide awake.  Continued to remain alert, but took a nap from 7-8:15p anyway, where I managed to fall asleep moderately well.  Woke up feeling very refreshed and alert.

<b>12 June:</b> Went to sleep at 1:45a and woke up at 7a feeling fine [5.25hrs].  Decided it was too early and I might as well sleep in to 8a [6.25hrs].  Felt a bit tired throughout the day until I ate lunch at 12:30p; afterward I felt fine.  Continued to remain alert until around 7p, which is precisely when I had scheduled a nap.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to nap then as I was with a friend, so I continued to remain tired until I napped at 10p.  Woke up at 11:15p feeling refreshed.

<b>13 June:</b> Got tired around 1:45a, but didn't go to sleep until 3a, and was fine throughout that time.  Woke up at 8:30a [5.5hrs] feeling fine.  Remained alert and active throughout the day.  Took a nap at 6:45p even though I wasn't feeling all that tired.  Ended up napping until 8:30p because of some issue with my alarm clock.  Continued to remain alert.

<b>14 June:</b> Went to sleep at 1:30a and woke up at 7a [5.5hrs].  Felt a little sleepy, so I slept in for 15 minutes [5.75hrs] and woke up feeling fine.  Felt alert throughout the day until around 8p and 12a, both times when I felt tired for about 20 minutes.  Because I was with Katie, I didn't take any naps.

<b>15 June:</b> I started nodding off at 2a and had to go to bed before even finishing my episode of Person of Interest.  I decided to sleep in all the way to 9:30a [7.5hrs].  This is strange because it felt like I was massively sleeping in (I woke up feeling like I slept 9 or 10 hours), but was surprised to see that it was my normal sleeping time of 7.5 hours.  I wasn't too tired at 8p when I decided to take a nap, but I ended up napping for 1.75hrs because it felt nice and I was tired after all.  I woke up from my nap feeling more tired than before I napped.

<b>16 June:</b> Went to sleep at 2:30a, still not feeling quite tired.  Set the alarm for 8a [5.5hrs] and woke up fine at that time, but fell back asleep without re-setting the alarm, and slept all the way to 10:45a [8.25hrs].

<b>17 June:</b> Went to sleep at 2a, still not feeling quite tired.  Set the alarm for 7a [5hrs], but decided to sleep in until 7:30a [5.5hrs].  I was pretty sleepy waking up, but shook out of it in about three minutes.  Was alert the entire day.  Took a nap 6:45-7:45p.  I didn't feel tired, but I was able to fall asleep fine and woke up feeling tired, but was able to quickly shake out of it.

<b>18 June:</b> Went to sleep at 2:30a feeling tired.  Meant to wake up at 7:30a [5hrs], but ended up falling back asleep and woke up at 9:15a [6.75hrs].  Earlier I had been in the practice of going back to sleep for 15 more minutes, but this is proving to be too dangerous.  I need to take extra care to not fall back asleep after I wake up.  Took a nap at 7:45-8:30p, and felt tired after waking up from the nap but was later fine.

<b>19 June:</b> Went to sleep at 2:30a, not feeling all that tired.  Aimed to wake up at 7:30a [5hrs], but chose to go back to sleep and wake up at 8:15a [5.75hrs] instead.  Forgot to nap earlier and ended up in a position where I couldn't.  I got really, really tired around 10p.  Eventually I just went to bed.

<b>20 June:</b> Following being really, really tired, I went to bed at 12:30a and slept all the way to 9:30a [9hrs].  Got tired at 10:30p.

<b>21 June:</b> Went to bed at 2am, pretty tired.  Woke up at 7:30a [5.5hrs].  Decided to go back to sleep for 15 minutes.  Forgot to reset the alarm, and ended up waking up at 10a [8hrs].  This is a recurring theme, and I really need to stop letting myself go back to sleep.

<b>22 June:</b> Went to bed at 1:30am and woke up at 8:30am [7hrs], because I knew I wouldn't be able to get a nap in today.  It's now been four straight days where I haven't been able to get a nap in, which is derailing the plan.  I owe this to having a summer schedule where I regularly spend something like 5-11p with either my girlfriend or my family.  I wish I could be strict about getting a nap, but I can't, and that's ok, but frustrating for this experiment.  Maybe I could try and experiment with getting an early nap in?

<b>23 June:</b> Got pretty sleepy around midnight and decided to go to bed early at 12:30a.  Knew I was really tired and still probably wouldn't be able to nap, decided  to sleep until 8a [7.5hrs].

<b>24 June:</b> I intended to go to sleep at 2:30a, but I was so sleepy that I went to bed at 2:15a, pausing my television show half-way through.  I woke up at 8:30a [6.25hrs].  I took a nap at 7:45p and woke up at 9p rather tired.  After I showered, however, I no longer felt tired.

<b>25 June:</b> I went to sleep at 1:30a, intending to wake up at 6:30a [5hrs].  I woke up in the middle of the night at 4:30a [3hrs] feeling pretty rested, but went back to sleep.  I ended up waking at 10a [8.5hrs], much to minor disaster.  My alarms are in working order, and I have no idea how this happened.

<b>26 June:</b> Went to sleep at 1:45a feeling pretty tired and woke up at 7:45a [6hrs] feeling fine.  This is a deliberate shift from a 5hrs core sleep + 1hr nap to a 6hrs core sleep + 30min nap, because the 5hrs sleep had started to fail with sleeping in, and this seemed more sustainable.  Today, I took a practice LSAT test from 11:15a to 1:45p and found no trouble with the questions or the focus, getting a score of 167.  I took a nap from 3:45p to 4:30p and felt very refreshed afterward, unlike past naps which lead me to feel even more tired after waking up.

<b>27 June:</b> I went to sleep at 12:30a, aiming to wake up at 6:30a [6hrs].  I woke up pretty tired and ended up sleeping in to 7a [6.5hrs].  After I woke up, I felt very tired until about 8:30a.  I didn't have a cup in my room, so I wasn't able to drink water easily, and I think that would have helped.  I took a nap at 4:15p and woke up at 4:45p feeling refreshed.

<b>28 June:</b> I went to sleep at 1a, aiming to wake up at 7a [6hrs].  Like the previous day, I woke up pretty tired and ended up sleeping in until 7:45a [6.75hrs].  I never felt like I needed a nap.  I ended up pretty tired around 6:30p in the car, but snapped out of it.

<b>29 June:</b> I got tired around 12:45a and went to sleep at 1:15a.  Knew I wouldn't nap during the day, so I decided to sleep as long as I wanted.  Ended up getting up at 9:45a [8.5hrs].  Wasn't tired for the rest of the day.

<b>30 June:</b> I got tired around 12:30a and went to sleep at 1:15a.  I again decided to sleep as long as I wanted and woke up at 10:15a [9hrs].

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jul">July 2013</h2>
<b>1 July:</b> I got tired around 12:30a and went to sleep at 1:15a.  I woke up at 7:15a [6hrs] and then went back to sleep for fifteen minutes [6.25hrs].  Woke up great with no grogginess.  Felt a bit tired around 4p and napped from 4:30-5:15p.

<b>2 July:</b> Felt tired around 12:30a and went to sleep at 1a.  Woke up at 7a [6hrs], but then fell back asleep without resetting my alarm.  I ended up waking up at 8a [7hrs].  I also took a nap from 4:45-5:15p and felt tired at 10p.

<b>3 July:</b> Felt tired around 12:30a, but didn't go to sleep until around 2a.  Woke up at 8a [6hrs], but then -- just like yesterday -- fell back asleep without resetting my alarm.  I ended up waking up at 9a [7hrs].  I felt actually pretty tired around 4p, so I took a nap.  I ended up waking up naturally and pretty well-rested just fifteen minutes later.  I ended up getting pretty tired around 10p.

<b>4 July:</b> Felt tired around 12:30a and went to sleep then.  Woke up at 6:30a [6hrs] and wanted to go to back sleep.  But I was using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kog.alarmclock&hl=en">the "I Can't Wake Up" Alarm Clock</a> which won't turn off until you complete various puzzle tasks, like math problems.  I was alert then after.  I ended up snapping awake a few minutes into doing the puzzles.  I later took a nap at 3:30p, woke up naturally around 3:45p, but decided to go back to sleep and woke up with the alarm at 4p feeling refreshed.  I got pretty sleepy around 8p, but woke myself up successfully by putting some cold water on the back of my neck.  After that, I remained alert for the rest of the day.

<b>5 July:</b> Went to sleep at 1a and woke up at 7a [6hrs]. Like yesterday, I wanted to go back to sleep and would have, if not for the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kog.alarmclock&hl=en">the "I Can't Wake Up" Alarm Clock</a> which won't turn off until you complete various puzzle tasks, like math problems.  The rest of the day felt a bit sluggish and forgetful, but I still managed to do a lot.  I didn't take my nap till 5:15p, but I didn't feel tremendously tired before then, either.  I woke up feeling refreshed like usual.  I ended up getting <i>very</i> tired around 10p, basically falling asleep on the couch.  I probably could have done something to shake it off (drink something, splash myself with water, etc.), but chose not to.

<b>6 July:</b> Went to sleep at 1a, but had some trouble falling asleep and didn't really fall asleep until 1:30a.  I woke up at 7:30a [6hrs] just fine, but felt absolutely dead -- I can't remember ever feeling more tired before.  So I went back to sleep for a half hour and woke up at 8a [6.5hrs], feeling much better.  I was noticeably more alert and creative than yesterday, but I still was rather forgetful throughout the day.  I took a nap from 3:30-3:50p -- I had a bit of trouble falling asleep for it, but woke up for it well rested.

<b>7 July:</b> Went to sleep at 12:45a and woke up at 6:30a [5.75hrs].  Felt surprisingly great -- I'm not sure if it was the increased sleep from yesterday or the decreased sleep today (and presumably better time to wake up).  Napped 4:15-4:35p.  Didn't feel tired until 11:30p.

<b>8 July:</b> Went to sleep at midnight and woke up at 6:30a [6.5hrs].  Felt a little sluggish getting up, but went the rest of the day feeling normal.  I took a nap from 1:30-2p and it went well.  I didn't have my usual 10:30p crash.

<b>9 July:</b> Went to sleep at 12:15a and woke up at 6a [5.75hrs].  Felt pretty tired and continued to feel tired until around 10a.  Exercise and a shower woke me up, but briefly.  What did end up energizing me, however, was getting deeply involved in tasks, taking my nap, and perhaps sugar.  After my nap, I felt fine for the rest of the day.  I napped 12:45-1:05p. I woke up in the middle of the nap (after ten minutes, but it felt like an hour) and went back to sleep.

<b>10 July:</b> Went to sleep at 12a (sort of) and woke up at 6:30a (sort of) [6.5hrs].  I had some trouble going to sleep.  I also woke up a bit early (didn't check the time) and went back to sleep.  I think I was nervous about taking my driver's test today.  I ended up failing my test.  I didn't feel tired at all during the test, but this could be taken as evidence of general cognitive decline.  I took a nap 2-2:30p.  Tomorrow I will be going to Oxford, England, so to help prepare for the change in timezones, I went to sleep at 11p EDT / 4a WEST.

<b>11 July:</b> I'm still at home, but I will be traveling to Oxford, England today.  I woke up really early at 4:45a EDT / 9:45a WEST [5.75hrs] in preparation for the time zone switch.  My sleep at night wasn't the best, with some trouble falling asleep and multiple wake ups in the middle of the night.  I did not record when my wake ups were.  After waking up, I didn't feel all that tired, but I definitely felt more sluggish than ever before, and wasn't able to accomplish anything other than reading in the first hour.

<b>12 July:</b> Heading to Oxford, I slept on plane from 2-5:30a WEST [3.5hrs].  I napped from 12:30-1p.  Overall, I felt more fine than I would expect, but things were a bit hazy and I had some trouble focusing on things.  I suspect this means I'm getting enough sleep from my normal biphasic schedule, since I was able to survive the truncated sleep.  I had some microsleeping throughout the second trip to Wales, and also took an unintentional twenty minute nap.

<b>13 July:</b> I went to sleep at 1a and woke up at 7:30a [6.5hrs].  I woke up pretty tired and was having some microsleeps.  I napped 12-12:30p and felt much better afterward.

<b>14 July:</b> I stayed up until 2:30a talking to people.  I then decided to sleep as long as I wanted to help with jet lag and inconsistent bed times, and ended up waking up at noon [9.5hrs].  I felt much better.

<b>15 July:</b> I went to sleep at 11:30a, but had a lot of trouble falling asleep, and didn't fall asleep until 12:45a.  I woke up at 6:45a [6hrs].  I did not nap.  I felt pretty awake until midnight.

<b>16 July:</b> I went to sleep at 1a, feeling fairly tired.  I was sleeping on a couch, which was comfy, but not the best.  I woke up at 7a [6hrs], but felt tired.  My alarm had not been set up to demand an extended wake up time, so I was able to fall back asleep.  I then woke up at 8a [7hrs], but didn't feel any better.  I also did not take a nap.

<b>17 July:</b> I went to sleep at 12:30p, but had a bit of trouble falling asleep.  I was sleeping on a nice bed, this time.  I woke up naturally at 5:30a [5.5hrs], but decided to go back to bed until 7:15a [6.75hrs].  I was pretty hazy and tired for the morning.  I took a nap from 11:15 to 11:45a and felt good after that.

<b>18 July:</b> I went to sleep at 12:45p.  I woke up at 6:45a [6hrs], but even after my alarm, still felt really sleepy, so I went back to sleep and woke up at 7:15a [6.5hrs] and then again at 7:45a [7hrs].  I took a nap at 11:15a.  I felt sufficiently awake all day.

<b>19 July:</b> I went to sleep at midnight.  I woke up naturally at 6:18a, but went back to sleep until 6:30a [6.5hrs].  I felt pretty tired after waking up and was struggling to stay awake.  Half an hour later, I ended up taking my nap <i>very</i> early, from 7:30-8a.  After that, I felt like normal and was sufficiently awake all day.

<b>20 July:</b> I went to sleep at 1a.  I forgot to set my alarm and slept in until 9a [8hrs].  I felt like normal and was sufficiently awake all day.

<b>21 July:</b> I went to sleep at 2a.  I woke up naturally at 6:18a [4.25hrs], but went back to sleep until 7:30a [6hrs], but even after my alarm, still felt really sleepy, so I went back to sleep and woke up at 9a [7hrs].  I didn't take a nap.  I felt like normal and was sufficiently awake all day until I started getting tired around 11p.

<b>22 July:</b> I don't know what happened.  I must have been sick or something, because I felt terrible.  I went to bed at midnight and woke up at 6:15a by alarm [6.25hrs].  But then I decided to go back to sleep.  I then continued to repeat this process for more than three hours, finally getting out of bed at 9:30a [9.5hrs].  I even spent about half an hour asleep on the floor of my room.  I felt like normal the rest of the day.

<b>23 July:</b> The same thing that happened to me yesterday happened again.   I went to bed at 1a and woke up at 7a by alarm [6hrs].  But then I decided to go back to sleep.  I then continued to repeat this process for more than three hours, finally getting out of bed at 9:45a [8.75hrs].  I felt like normal the rest of the day.

<b>24 July:</b>  I went to sleep at 12:30a.  I woke up at 6:30a [6hrs].  I was not able to nap due to time constraints.  I felt pretty tired at 11a, but felt awake the rest of the day.  At some points I think I was a bit more forgetful than usual, but I still found myself creative and intelligent.

<b>25 July:</b>  I went to sleep at 12:15a and I woke up at 6:45a [6hrs].  I felt pretty tired throughout the day and went through two "dead periods" -- 10-10:30a and 2-2:30p where I basically kept falling asleep.  I eventually was able to nap from 3:30-4:30p.  Afterwards, I felt normal.

<b>26 July:</b>  I went to sleep at 12:30a and I woke up at 7:00a [6.5hrs] and napped from 11:30a-noon.  The day felt normal and nice.

<b>27 July:</b> I decided to shake things up and switch sleep schedules to <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/dual-core/">Dual Core 1</a>.  I slept from 11p-2:30a [3.5hrs], from 5:30-8:30a [3hrs, total 6hrs], and napped from 3:30-3:50a [20min, total 6.3hrs].  I felt a little groggy in between the core sleeps (2:30-5:30a), but felt great the rest of the day.  Note that ideally the second core is supposed to be shorter.  I actually woke up naturally around 6:30a or so, but went back to sleep.

<b>28 July:</b> Dual Core 1 didn't go so well this time.  I slept from 11p-2:30a [3.5hrs], but woke up more tired than I had ever felt in a long time, and ended up going back to bed after only half an hour.  I then slept all the way until 8p [5hrs, 8.5hrs total].  I still felt tired throughout the day, so I took a nap from 3-3:20p [8.8hrs total].

<b>29 July:</b> I woke up from my 11p-2:30a [3.5hrs] initial core fine, but felt pretty tired.  I went to bed at 4:30a and then ended up sleeping in all the way until 8:30a [4hrs, 7.5hrs total].  I felt fine until about 3p, when I felt really tired again.  I ended up napping from 4:15-4:35p [20min, 7.8hrs total].

<b>30 July:</b>  I woke up from an 11p-2a [3hrs] core sleep and felt much better than before, indicating that this was probably a much better time to wake up.  However, I didn't feel very motivated to do anything and ended up putting my head down.  I quickly fell back asleep until 4a [5hrs total].  I also slept from 6-7a [6hrs total], 10-10:20a [6.3hrs total], and 4:50-5:10p [6.6hrs total].  I felt pretty sleepy around 3p again.  (Ideally I would nap then, but I was still at work.)

<b>31 July:</b>  I went to sleep at 12:15a.  I woke up at 3:15a [3hrs] and felt pretty good, but then ended up falling asleep in a way I still don't quite understand and sleeping all the way until 8:45a [8.5hrs total].  I didn't nap the rest of the day.  I felt a little tired at 3p, but otherwise felt fine.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="aug">Aug 2013</h2>
<b>1 Aug:</b>I went to sleep at 12:15a.  I woke up at 3:15a [3hrs] and felt pretty good and managed to stay awake for an hour, but I then again ended up falling asleep in a way I still don't quite understand and sleeping all the way until 8:30a [7.25hrs total].  I didn't nap the rest of the day.  I felt a little tired at 3p, but otherwise felt fine.

<b>2 Aug:</b> Today I spent only five hours and ten minutes asleep, but felt better than I've felt in a long time.  I went to bed at midnight and woke up at 3a [3hrs].  I then went to bed at 5a and woke up at 6:30a [1.5hrs, 4.5hrs total].  I took a nap at 8:30a and a nap at 3:30p [5.1hrs total].  I had a noticable slump at 2p (if only I could nap earlier) and I feel like the 8:30a nap may be unnecessary.  We'll see if this is just a one time thing or something sustainable.

<b>3 Aug:</b> It looks like one time thing; things blew up again.  I went to bed at 10:45p and woke up at 1:45a [3hrs].  I felt pretty sleepy at first, but was able to snap out of it.  I then went to bed at 4:30a.  The trouble is I went to bed again after I woke up, and didn't wake up until 10:30a [6hrs, 9hrs total].  Time to try again.

<b>4 Aug:</b> Today went pretty well.  I went to bed at 11p and woke up at 2a [3hrs].  I then went to bed at 4:30a and woke up at 5:30a [1hr, 4hrs total].  I took a nap at 8:30a and a nap at 3:30p, but overslept the nap at 3:30p by an hour [6.1hrs total].  I didn't feel all that tired at any point during the day.

<b>5 Aug:</b> Today also went well.  I went to sleep at 11:30p and woke up at 2:30a [3hrs].  I felt kind of fine, but spent two hours watching television because I never felt awake enough to be motivated to do productive work.  Eventually I got caught up chatting people online who were in a different timezone, and didn't end up going back to sleep again until 6a.  I chose to sleep longer, sleeping until 8a [2hrs, 5hrs total] and then skipped my 8a nap.  I then napped when I got home at 4:30p [20mins, 5.3hrs total] and napped a third time at 7p [20mins, 5.5hrs total] before going out to dinner.  I felt pretty awake throughout the day after waking up from the second sleep at 8a.  This 3hr - 2hr - 20 min - 20min split might be an interesting model to continue rather than my previous 3hr - 1hr - 20min - 20min.

<b>6 Aug:</b> I went to sleep at 11p and woke up at 2a [3hrs] like planned, but then fell back asleep until 6:30a [7.5hrs total].  I took a nap at 8:30a [8hrs total].

<b>7 Aug:</b> I went to sleep at 1a and woke up at 4a [3hrs].  I then went to sleep again at 5:45a, but overslept this one until 8:30a [2.75hrs, 5.75hrs total].  I napped at 5:30p because that was when I got home [20mins, 6.1hrs total].  Overall, despite the oversleep, I still didn't sleep that much relative to a monophasic schedule and felt pretty awake throughout the day.

<b>8 Aug:</b> I went to sleep at midnight and decided to try and sleep until 4a this time [4hrs] to see if I would feel more awake when I woke up.  I woke up twice during this time period, once at 1a [1hr] and another time I didn't record.  I didn't feel all that more awake.  I went back to sleep at 6a and woke up at 6:40a [40min, 4.6hrs total] feeling much better.  I felt a little tired around 10a, but felt awake otherwise throughout the day.  I took a nap at 8:30a [20min, 4.9hrs total].  I also took another nap at 3:30p when I got back home and ended up oversleeping it a bit, sleeping for an hour [5.9hrs total].

<b>9 Aug:</b> I slept from 12a to 4a [4hrs] and woke up feeling fine.  I went back to bed at 6a and ended up oversleeping to 8:15a [2.25hrs, 6.25hrs total].  I also took a nap at 4p that I ended up oversleeping until 6:45p [2.75hrs, 9hrs total].

<b>10 Aug:</b> I went to bed at 12:30a, woke up and then immediately fell back asleep, sleeping until 9:15a [8.75hrs].  Yet I still felt a bit tired throughout the day.

<b>11 Aug:</b> I decided to switch to an <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/everyman/">Everyman Schedule</a> and just try to see how long I can maintain consistent times.  Today, things went fine.  I slept 1-4a [3hrs] and napped at 8:30a [20mins, 3.3hrs total], 3:30p [20mins, 3.6hrs total], and 8:30p [20mins, 4hrs total].  It was amazing to feel pretty good throughout the day on only four hours sleep.  It certainly made the day feel very long.  The only problem was I crashed a bit at 11:30a, almost falling asleep.  We'll see if this can last more than one day.

<b>12 Aug:</b> I ended up going to bed at 1a and woke up at 4a [3hrs].  I felt oddly not sleepy, but ended up going back to sleep anyway for some reason (I think I was a bit delirious) and woke up again at 5:30a [4.5hrs].  I napped at 8a and overslept to 9a [1hrs, 5.5hrs total].  I also napped at 3:30p and 7:15p [20mins each, 6.1hrs total].  Most of the day went fine, but I had a crash at 6:30a where I felt really tired and even fell asleep for maybe 5-10 minutes around 7a without noticing I had fallen asleep.  I also had a crash around 2p.

<b>13 Aug:</b> I went to bed at 12:30a and woke up at 4a [3.5hrs] and felt oddly not sleepy but again went back to sleep for some reason and didn't wake up until 7:45a [7.25hrs total].  I felt tired around 10:30a and napped at 11:15a [7.5hrs total] but didn't really fall asleep because I was on a couch near a noisy fan.  I also napped at 5:30p and overslept this nap to 7:30p [2hrs, 9.5hrs total].  I felt pretty good and awake after that nap.

<b>14 Aug:</b> Pretty much the same thing a third time.  I went to bed at 1:30a and woke up at 7:30a [6hrs] after going back to sleep unintentionally.  I took naps at 8:30a, 11:30a, and 3:30p [7hrs total].

<b>15 Aug:</b> I went to bed at midnight and woke up at 3a successfully [3hrs], but woke up pretty sleepy.  I napped from 5 to 5:40a, 7:30-9a, and 3:30-3:50p [5.5hrs total].  The 7:30a nap was an oversleep.

<b>16 Aug:</b> I went to bed at 12:30a, woke up at 4a and went back to sleep until 6:30a [6hrs].  I napped at 8:30a and 3:30p.  I was pretty tired before my 8:30a nap.

<b>17 Aug:</b> I went to bed at 12a, woke up at 4a and went back to sleep until 9:15a [9.25hrs].  I did not nap.

<b>18 Aug:</b> I initially tried to go to bed at 11p (on the 17th), but was woken up to socialize.  I ended up going to bed at 1a.  I slept till 4a [3hrs] and napped at 6a and 8:30a [3.6hrs total].  I felt pretty active and awake throughout the entire day.  Where things got weird was I took a third nap at 4:45p, woke up a little tired and went back to sleep, and then didn't wake up until 7:45p [3hrs, 6.6hrs total].

<b>19 Aug:</b> I went to bed at 12:30a and woke up at 6a [5.5hrs].  I napped at 8:30 [20min, 5.8hrs total] and 5:45p [1hr, 6.8hrs total].  Sleeping the full hour at 5:45p was a mistake and I woke up very tired.

<b>20 Aug:</b> I went to bed at 10:30p the previous day and woke up at 4a [5.5hrs].  The 5.5hrs core seems stable.  I napped at 6:30a, 8:30a, and 4:30p [20mins each, 6.5hrs total].

<b>21/22 Aug:</b> I spent this time traveling and slept on planes erraticly, so I didn't log it.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Peter,
this log reminds me a lot of things! 

I've been doing polyphasic sleeping for 10 months (Everyman with two naps). It was very hard at the beginning but it's OK now (well, to be honnest I still oversleep some nights). I've experienced some serious memory issues. Did you experience that too?

I've just launched a blog to cover this subject: <a href="http://www.biphasicsleep.com" rel="nofollow">www.biphasicsleep.com</a>. I add content on a very regular basis, so check it out!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What am I grateful for?  I'm keeping a log here, to reflect!  I'm doing this because <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/for-happiness-keep-a-gratitude-journal/">psychology research shows it will boost my happiness</a>.

<b>1 July:</b> I'm grateful that my friend Josh takes time away from South Africa and uses what little internet time he has to work on making Venture Philanthropy great.  I'm grateful for my brother and his willingness to pretty much drop everything and help me learn how to drive.  I'm also grateful for Apple products -- I now have a new iPad and Macbook air and they're working wonderfully!<!--more-->

<b>2 July:</b> I'm grateful for my girlfriend, who is so supportive and kind.  She's really great to relax with.

<b>3 July:</b> I'm grateful for fireflies and swimming pools, and a girlfriend to share them with.  I'm grateful for thinking about gratefulness.

<b>4 July:</b> I'm grateful for the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kog.alarmclock&hl=en">"I Can't Wake Up" alarm clock app</a> for hopefully saving me from the curse of oversleeping and <a href="trello.com">Trello</a> for keeping my to-do list.  I'm also grateful for fireworks and family.

<b>5 July:</b> I'm grateful for televisions and music.

<b>6 July:</b> I'm grateful for my girlfriend, who I've spent a lot of time with recently.  I'm grateful for the people playing banjo at the park, as well as parks in general.  I'm grateful for a father who goes above and beyond for me in many ways.

<b>7 July:</b> I'm grateful for peanut butter.  I'm grateful for my hardworking Mom.

<b>8 July:</b> I'm grateful for positive psychology and swimming pools.

<b>9 July:</b> I'm grateful for electronic books and my iPad.

<b>10 July:</b> I'm grateful for my brother.

<b>15 July:</b> I'm grateful for the effective altruism movement, Giving What We Can, and fun people to live with!

<b>16 July:</b> I'm grateful for peanut butter, public transit, and people who cook food for me.

<i>I have now stopped keeping my gratitude journal, because I found that I'm already happy enough that I'm not getting good returns here, and keeping this long in addition to all my other logs was starting to get annoying.</i>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[People say there are only 24 hours in a day, and you can't make the day any longer.  This is true -- to a point.  Really, however, when you're sleeping eight hours a night, there are only 16 hours in a day, and you can make the day longer by <i>sleeping less</i>. To be blunt: sleeping feels like a waste of time.  It's fun to fall asleep and it's fun to be in bed, but I really wish it didn't have to take so long.

Unfortunately, you can't just sleep less and expect to be fine.  Sleeping is mostly a mystery, but not sleeping enough makes me feel really crappy, and seems unhealthy.  Therefore, I've decided to sleep only six hours a night and take <a href="">I've been keeping a daily log</a> of my sleep, doing my best to track how different sleep schedules affect my feelings of grogginess throughout the day, productivity, mood, attitude, alertness, creativity, and athletic ability.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Theory</h2>
Quite a few people have anecdotally confirmed that one can start with the traditional eight hours of being awake and peel off an hour and a half in exchange for a twenty minute nap (i.e. sleeping 6 hours at night with a 20 minute nap at midday, rather than sleeping 8 hours at night).  For example, see <a href="http://dustincurtis.com/sleep.html">Dustin Curtis</a>, <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/>The Polyphasic Society</a>, <a href="www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2011/03/biphasic-sleep/">Steve Pavlina</a>, <a href="http://www.ndoherty.com/siesta/">Niall Doherty</a>, and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5302591/implement-advanced-siestas-for-improved-sleep">Lifehacker</a>.  This is, presumably and speculatively, because naps are more efficient for REM sleep.

This principle of exchanging 1hr40min of "core sleep" at night for naps seems to work indefinitely, even to the point of a sleep schedule that consists of only six 20-minute naps, called the "Uberman" sleep schedule.  Such a schedule is difficult to adapt to and fit in to a normal social life, so I'm going to not go quite that crazy.

Instead, I'm going to stick with the "siesta" method for awhile.  I don't want to mess with my sleep too much if I don't understand it, but increased time is very helpful, and I would be willing to sacrifice a little to experiment with gaining it.  Right now, I'm aiming to be asleep 1-7am and nap 4-4:30pm, but I've been experimenting with moving this around, cutting it further, and sleeping longer.

<b>The idea isn't to sleep deprive yourself.</b>  At least, not in the long-run.  If everything is going to plan, you should be able to sleep for less time AND get a higher quality sleep, continuing to wake up more refreshed than you did before, and remaining more alert than you did before.  That being said, <a href="">this probably doesn't work for everyone</a>.  And some people need more sleep than others.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Learning to Nap</h2>
For me, the ideal amount of time to nap is twenty minutes.  And by this, I actually mean twenty minutes, <i>including time spent going to sleep</i> -- I get to my bed, set the alarm for twenty minutes in the future, put my head down, go to sleep, actually sleep, and wake up all within twenty minutes.  I tried 90 minutes and I've tried 30 minutes, and both times I woke up groggy.  If you're doing the nap right, you should wake up feeling great and ready to go.

I can drift off to sleep in about five minutes or less, I think.  One thing that really helped me was developing habits of counting and clearing my mind.  I put my head on the pillow and start to breath slowly.  I then count my breaths, counting "1" as I breathe in, "2" as I breathe out, "3" as I breathe in again, etc.  I try my hardest to focus on this counting and not think of anything else.  I also try hard to think in pictures and create dreams.  Often, I'll try to imagine pictures of some of my favorite places, or literally "count sheep" by imagining a sheep hopping over a fence for each number that I count.

I'd have no clue if this would work for anyone else.  I've heard that naps take practice like anything else.  My naps kind of sucked for the first two weeks, but now I can take a twenty minute nap and feel like I just slept for a few hours.  If you're having trouble napping after two weeks of practice, you're probably making classic mistakes like having your nap at the wrong time (and not being tired enough), drinking caffeine, or exercising / eating too close to your nap.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>One Month Analysis</h2>
Overall, my attempt to make this sleep schedule was not as stable as I would have liked.  I initially tried to do five hours of sleep at night with a ninety minute nap in the day, which is another method of siesta sleep that also is said to work well.  I started on 4 June, and kept it up for two days before messing up.  On 11 June I tried again and kept it up for five days.  I was then able to keep it up from 19 to 21 June.

But how did I do?

<b>Total time spent asleep:</b> From 3 Jun to 3 July, I spent 221 hours asleep, for an average of 7.5 hours a day.  This is about the average I'd get during a disciplined school year, but I'd usually feel pretty crappy about it.  Normally during the summer when I can sleep as long as I want, I sleep 8.5 hours a night.  Therefore, I've gained about 30 extra hours of wakefulness this month, basically creating more than a whole day out of nothing.

<b>Grogginess:</b> On my normal (monophasic) method of sleep, I'd have to sleep more than 7.5 hours a night, or I'd feel really groggy, and I'd usually get 51-59 hours of sleep a week.  Currently, I'm feeling like I do when I get 59 hours of sleep a week, but with only 52 hours of sleep a week.  If this holds, I have the potential to get 45-49 hours of sleep a week and still feel just as rested throughout the day.  One potential problem, however, is grogginess on waking.  This still occurs a lot, leading me to mess things up by going back to sleep.  I need to be more disciplined about this and work to fix my sleeping times so I wake up less groggy.  Oversleeping also remains a risk, though it was only harmful one time.

<b>Productivity/Alertness:</b> I owe this also to <a href="">my New Years Resolutions commitment device</a>, but productivity has shot through the roof.  Before, on a summer day, I'd be "wasting" about ten hours a day on sleep, games, and aimless reading.  Now, I'm "wasting" about eight hours, tops.  I've gained a solid 2-3 hours of extra work per day, without feeling exhausted.  I also feel pretty alert and focused throughout the day, especially after the nap.

<b>Mood/Attitude:</b> It's hard to remember what my mood was like beforehand, but this feels about the same.  I've tried to track in my log where I've felt especially irritable, and so far it's only happened once.

<b>Creativity:</b> Likewise, it's hard to remember how creative I was beforehand, but I feel about as creative, if not maybe a little more creative.

<b>Athletic Ability:</b> Athletic ability has remained stable, I think.  I initially lost some ability in running and strength, but that was due to not keeping up to consistent exercise, I think, rather than sleeping.  (And the lack of consistency was due to travel, not to sleep.)  I was able to regain all my strength and still make a personal running distance record while sleeping less.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
I have a lot left to learn and need a lot more practice, but this seems promising.

I did have this problem, and I do think I overcame it.  I added some content to the blog post to answer your question (see the new section "Learning to Nap".

None of these have been a problem for me.  Except maybe slouching; though, I've always had a problem with slouching.  I think the best evidence that biphasic sleep is impacting me negatively is that I'm more forgetful than normal.  But I don't think that's enough evidence.

<b>@joseph:</b>
<blockquote>Though, at best, your reports will be anecdotal, might I suggest some sort of randomly chosen (i.e. new each time) mental test to assess alertness? Training will inevitably interfere with the results, so perhaps find a friend as a control</blockquote>

Yeah, it won't be scientific, especially because I also haven't made a consistent schedule, and alertness is impacted by more than just your current sleep (but also past sleeps), etc.  I don't really want to spend all that much time on mental tests because I think I can reliably assess whether or not I'm performing as well as I'd like (maintaining insightfulness/creativity, making mistakes, etc.).

One form of mental test that might work, however, are the LSAT and GRE practice tests I'm taking.  I don't have monophasic sleep baselines for them, but I can report that the scores I have are pretty good.  If they're scores achieved under cognitive deficit, I'm a lot better at standardized tests than I had thought.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whenever you think you have an obvious answer to a question that has been debated for several thousand years by some of the greatest philosophers, and you're just a college student, one would be justified in presuming you to be a bit arrogant.

Of course, while I try to be a bit humble about it, this describes me all to well -- on both accounts of atheism and morality, and several other things.  Whether this counts as grounds to dismiss all of my ideas without considering them -- well, that's your fallacy to commit.

Very few other topics have had more ink and electrons dedicated to them than studying the topic of morality.  However, despite tens of thousands of pages, all that remains is the same amount of confusion as where we started.  It should be obvious that if a process goes through thousands of years of thinking and emerges with nothing to show for it, something isn't just wrong with the answers, but with the <i>process that is generating those answers</i>.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Which Problem, Exactly?</h2>
When it comes to morality, there are actually two types, <b>descriptive ethics</b> and <b>normative ethics</b> (the terms <i>morality</i> and <i>ethics</i> are often used interchangeably).  Descriptive ethics describes what a society, group, or individual currently thinks is "right" and "wrong", whereas normative ethics describes what a society, group, or individual <i>should</i> say is "right" or "wrong", or what <i>actually</i> is "right" or "wrong", if there is such a thing.

Descriptive ethics is a question for anthropologists, and not all that interesting to us at the moment.  So we're going to set aside descriptive ethics and focus on normative ethics.  Within normative ethics, there are three different key questions to answer, each getting more general:

<ul>
<li><b>The question of applied ethics:</b> Which specific things are right and wrong?  Is eating meat wrong?  Is abortion wrong?  Is murder wrong?</li>
<li><b>The question of ethics:</b> Which processes should we use to answer questions of applied ethics?  What makes eating meat right or wrong?</li>
<li><b>The question of meta-ethics:</b> What does morality describe?  What is "right" referring to, exactly?
</ul>

Luckily, all three of those questions can typically be answered by answering these five questions:

<ol>
<li>Do moral statements like "Abortion is wrong" actually communicate something that is truth-apt?</li>
<li>If yes, do moral statements communicate something that can sometimes be true?</li>
<li>If yes, are moral statements justified by appealing to descriptions of the world?</li>
<li>If yes, are these descriptions something other than people's opinions?</li>
<li>If yes, which descriptions should we specifically focus on?</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Moral Dispute</h2>
Unfortunately, there is disagreement on every step of those five questions, and there have been for centuries.  It seems like there has been little progress made in this philosophical field.

Take someone like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>.  He believes that statements like "abortion is wrong" can communicate something that is truth-apt, potentially true, a description of the world, independent of opinion, and absolute, because "abortion is wrong" refers to "abortion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics">is not virtuous</a>". (Note that's what the statement would refer to, not the statement that Aristotle or other virtue ethicists would necessarily accept as true.)

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a> agrees that "abortion is wrong" communicates something that is truth-apt, potentially true, a description of the world, independent of opinion, and absolute, but disagrees on question #5, because "abortion is wrong" refers to "we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology">a rational duty to not preform abortions</a>".

And someone like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham">Bentham</a> also agrees with Aristotle and Kant all the way to question #5, but says that we shouldn't care about virtue or duty, but rather should say that "abortion is wrong" refers to the claim that "abortion does not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism">maximize the pleasure of all sentient beings</a>".

Additionally, someone like <a href="http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/">Alonzo Fyfe</a> agrees with Aristotle, Kant, and Bentham until question #5, instead suggesting that "abortion is wrong" refers to the claim that "the desire to have an abortion is not a desire that we have, all things considered and all else being equal, a strong reason to promote".

And not to be outdone, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke">Locke</a> disagrees on #5, claiming that "abortion is wrong" means that "abortion is not something everyone would agree to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract">if signing a hypothetical social contract</a>".

Lastly, Rand disagrees with the whole crew on #5, saying that "abortion is wrong" is actually referring to the claim that "having an abortion is contrary to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">an individual's rational self-interest</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Morality Rooted in Preferences</h4>
And others take different paths on other points in the line of questions.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham">Ockham</a> disagrees on #4, saying that we should appeal to an opinion because "abortion is wrong" means that "abortion is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_command_theory">contrary to the commands of God</a>".

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Railton">Railton</a> argues that we should also appeal to opinion, but this time "abortion is wrong" has nothing to do with God, and instead means "abortion is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_observer_theory">what a perfectly rational and fully informed person would approve of</a>".

In further disagreement, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Westermarck">Westermarck</a> states that "abortion is wrong" means "abortion is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism">what our society approves of</a>".

Lastly for this group, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Harman">Harman</a> also disagrees, thinks that being moral is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism">what the individual approves of</a>.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Morality as an Irreducible Truth</h4>
<b>Others disagree on #3.</b>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Boyd">Boyd</a> thinks that "abortion is wrong" is a truth-apt, potentially true statement, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_realism">is irreducible, thus not justifiable by appeal to other facts</a>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Morality as Systematically False</h4>
<b>Others disagree on #2.</b>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._L._Mackie">Mackie</a> holds that while morality is something that is truth-apt, it is not something that can be true, because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_nihilism">statements about morality refer to properties that don't exist</a>, like intrinsic value.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Morality as Not Truth-Apt</h4>
In case you're sensing a pattern, <b>others disagree on #1</b>.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._Stevenson">Stevenson</a> believes that morality cannot be truth-apt because it does not express a proposition.  Instead, something like "abortion is wrong" is saying "Abortion! Boo! Ick! Hiss!" or something like "I disapprove of abortion, do so as well".

So there is dispute on every level of moral argument, and it's our job to see what is going on and unravel all this if we want to arrive at a moral theory that we can use confidently, if such a thing exists considering #1 and #2.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
So the current philosophy of ethics / morality / normativity seems pretty shaken up -- there are a lot of theories all over the place about how moral language functions, whether moral facts exists, and what we should do / ought do / must do.  In response to this, I'm starting this series where I seek to get to the bottom of all this.

In the next post, I'll ditch all these definitions and seek to provide my own account for the meaning of things like "good" and "ought".

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I wonder if the way you worded question 3 is really what you have in mind.  "[A]re moral statements justified by appealing to descriptions of the world?" is an epistemological question.  But you later seem to characterize this as the semantic question of whether moral <i>statements</i> are irreducible.  A related metaphysical claim would be that the moral <i>facts</i> are irreducible, as held by non-naturalist realists, but not Cornell realists.

It's worth noting that these three questions are distinct.  Even non-naturalist realists will allow that there's a sense in which descriptive claims (e.g. "Torturing puppies causes a great deal of pain") are what <i>justify</i> specific normative claims (e.g. "Torturing puppies is wrong").]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["Morality" is the intent to achieve good for others as well as for ourselves. 

A "moral" person seeks what is in fact beneficial for him or her self as well as for others. 

A "moral code" is a set of rules designed to accomplish morality's intent. A rule set may be as informal as manners and customs, or set down more specifically in ethical rules or principles, or more formally as laws. 

To the degree that the effects of an action in terms of benefits and harms can be determined accurately, moral judgment can be "scientific". On the other hand, when the effects of a given rule are less predictable or in dispute, moral judgment becomes more subjective. 

Two good and honest persons of moral intent may hold different views about the effects of a given rule. Therefore a process of research, discussion, and democratically voting upon a working rule is beneficial. After the working rule has been in play for a while, experience may provide better data, and the rule may be changed or removed. 

All philosophers who wish to deal with ethics must eventually recognize its grounding in moral intent. Every rule and principle is ultimately subject to this criteria for moral judgment: "How well does the rule accomplish good and reduce harm for everyone?"]]></wp:comment_content>

Looking at your "about" section I note you are an "undergraduate rising senior." Again could you explain to an ignoramus what this means?

A full-time intern is someone who works as an intern the same amount of time as a normal career (usually 40 hours a week).  An intern is like a volunteer for the organization who does work similar to an employee, but only for a small length of time in the year (I worked for six weeks), before leaving.

I wasn't working for Oxford University, but rather in a non-profit organization (Giving What We Can) that is based within Oxford University (in the Littlegate House).

An "undergraduate rising senior" is:
* undergraduate: someone completing their college education prior to grad school / law school / medical school / business school / other careers (usually people 18-22 years of age)
* senior: last year of college in a four-year college
* rising: in the summer between years, so not quite starting the year in question yet.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Peter Singer discusses in the New York Times about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/magazine/17charity.t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all">why giving to charity is important and how much one should give</a>.

You may know about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307887898">The Lean Startup</a>.  But <a href="http://intelligence.org/2013/04/04/the-lean-nonprofit/">can this apply to non-profits?</a>  Probably yes?

<a href="http://zenhabits.net/habitses/">"The Four Habits that Form Habits"</a>.  If you want to learn how to form good habits, you need to start from base habits that will support you in your quest for future good habits.  Otherwise, you'll constantly derail and give up.

It's difficult to give good advice about whether to go to graduate school or not, but here's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/04/graduate-school-advice-impossible-decision.html">good advice on avoiding bad advice</a>.<!--more-->

<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/cu2/the_power_of_reinforcement/">Five stories on the power of reinforcement</a>.  In interactions with people, one should pay attention to reinforcement, or the idea that rewarding people for certain behaviors <i>actually does</i> increase that behavior.

The overlap effect to skills is kind of interesting.  The idea is that certain skills share common traits, meaning you <a href="http://rationalsuperhero.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/the-priority-equation/">probably could speed up learning two different things</a> if they are sufficiently related (like French and Spanish, not French and mountain climbing).

Most of the time, I think, government social services helping the poor go right.  But sometimes, they go wrong, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/opinion/sunday/kristof-profiting-from-a-childs-illiteracy.html?ref=opinion&_r=2&">like by incentivizing parents to pull their children out of literacy programs</a> because the parents are afraid of losing government support for raising "disabled" children.

The United States spends <i>a lot</i> of money on preventing terrorist attacks.  But how cost-effective is this spending?  It's really hard to tell, because attacks that are prevented never happen, and therefore don't get counted.  For every attack that is foiled, dozens more might have been deterred entirely, and never started.  However, there's one thing we can calculate -- the expected damage from terrorist attacks compared to our spending on preventing them.  So how many terorrist attacks would we have to prevent or foil in order to make our big spending worth it?  <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/09/1667_times_squarestyle_attacks_every_year.html">One thousand, six hundred, sixty seven.</a>

People blame gerrymandering a lot for why the US Democratic party tends to underperform it's demographics -- winning a majority of the popular vote but a distinct minority of the seats in the House of Representatives, for example.  However, <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/04/06/gerrymandering-still-isnt-a-very-big-deal/">the evidence for gerrymandering is weak</a> and it's a lot more likely that Democrats are <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jowei/florida.pdf">"unintentionally gerrymandered"</a> [PDF] because their core voting population are concentrated in large cities.  Though, further thoughts <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/07/09/are-the-democrats-still-at-a-disadvantage-in-redistricting/">reveal a bit stronger of a case for gerrymandering</a> than first thought.

I'm probably overusing quantification and should <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=849">quantify with more care</a>.  Repeat after me: (1) one counter-intuitive study at 95% confidence doesn't mean I should take that study at face value and assign 95% probability to it's conclusion, (2) studies that seem to good to be true often are, (3) focusing too much on a correlation can derail it's effect, (4) beware of needless complication, (5) don't use big samples when small samples work fine, and (6) just because it sounds cool and impressive doesn't mean it's better than a simple and dumb solution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/to-peter-300x198.jpeg" alt="to peter" width="300" height="198" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-523" />Some people have committed a great deal of their lives to trying to best make the world a better place.  I'm trying to sit down with some of these people and learn more about their thoughts and motivations.

Today, I sit down with <b>Ruairí Donnelly</b>, a recent high school graduate and dedicated "effective altruist" and utilitarian, to see what he has to say.  Ruairí writes a blog called <a href="http://www.ruairidonnelly.com/">"Ruairí Loves"</a> which details "adventures in ethics, utilitarianism, antispeciesim, effective altruism, and veganism".<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>Peter Hurford:</b> I know a fair amount of utilitarians, and they're usually pretty young, like in their 20s or 30s.  But you're just out of high school, and were an active contributor to effective altruist and utilitarian hangouts while still in high school.  How did you get involved at such a young age?</i>

<b>Ruairí Donnelly:</b> In 2011, I thought that I should probably start deciding what I wanted to do with my life. I had always wanted to be a hero and I decided that the best way to do this was to prevent the most suffering I could and make the most happiness I could. I googled this and found that there was a word for this already, "Utilitarianism". I found <a href="http://www.felicifia.org">Felicifia</a>, a utilitarian forum where I was able to learn from a bunch of brilliant people and ask loads of annoying questions. "Effective altruism" was coined some time later and some of the people from Felicifia were involved in this, this is how I found effective altruism.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> When most people I know think of heroes, they think of firefighters or police officers or Jack Bauer stopping terrorists.  I don't know any that think of utilitarianism.  Why do you think that good heroes are utilitarians?</i>

<b>RD:</b> Well I certainly don't want to imply that these people aren't heroes. But sometimes I think we can get a little mixed up in our thinking about heroism. A hero is someone who strives to do a huge amount of good.  This doesn't necessarily imply rescuing people or being in dangerous situations at all, but this seems to be the kind of things we associate with heroes.

Before I discovered utilitarianism and effective altruism, I wanted to work in mountain rescue, but when I realized how much good I could do by working in other areas I changed my plans. So I think it's important for us not to mix up different ideas, a hero is someone who strives to do a lot of good and this is exactly what utilitarians also strive to do.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b>  What are you working on now that you’re out of high school?</i>

<b>RD:</b> For the next year I’ll be working on a bunch of different projects, mostly with a new group called "Animal Ethics", but also on some other effective altruist projects and on my future career plans.

Animal Ethics will work to spread anti-speciesism and prevent suffering, one area we are particularly interested in is the case of <a href="http://vimeo.com/58451841">suffering in the wild</a>. Helping wild animals is part of an anti-speciesist position and we hope to encourage people to think more about this important issue. It seems that movement building, values spreading and fundraising are currently three of the most effective activities for altruistic groups. Animal Ethics will be very involved in all of these.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> How did you get involved in worrying about wild animal suffering?  The idea of focusing on this cause is pretty out there, even among utilitarians, and there's a strong perception that either the wild isn't really "all that bad" or that there's not much that can be done to help wild animals.</i>

<b>RD:</b>  I don't think caring about wild animals is that unusual, especially among anti-speciesists, as it is part of their position. Many people seem to notice the many harms that happen to wild animals and the ways in which we can help them. Due to r-selection, the reproductive strategy of having a huge number of children, almost all of which then soon die, massive amounts of suffering occur in the wild. R-selection is the most common reproductive strategy in nature and if an animal population is remaining stable only one animal per parent will survive, all the rest will die. This entails suffering for astronomical numbers of animals as <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/number-of-wild-animals.html">the number of wild animals is simply enormous</a>. It’s true to say that the majority of the suffering in the world occurs in the wild.

It's certainly not true that there isn't much that can be done to help wild animals, already there have been many successful programs which have helped wild animals by using things such as vaccines. In the future when humanity has created more powerful technology it may be possible to aid wild animals in really awesome ways, but I'm sure that this will only happen if we build the foundations now, that is, it is vital that we show people that they are doing the right thing when they reduce the amount of suffering that occurs in nature.

Regarding the conditions of the lives of wild animals I would urge people to read the essays and papers written by Brian Tomasik and Oscar Horta, two of the most well known authorities in the world on this issue.  I'd suggest <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html">"The Importance of Wild Animal Suffering"</a>, <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/intervene-in-nature.html">"Should We Intervene in Nature"</a>, and <a href="http://academia.edu/2290959/Debunking_the_Idyllic_View_of_Natural_Processes_Population_Dynamics_and_Suffering_in_the_Wild">"Debunking the Idyllic View of Natural Processes: Population Dynamics and Suffering in the Wild"</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> I also see you're also thinking a lot about long-term career choice, what are your current thoughts?</i>

<b>RD:</b> I might <a href="http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give">"Earn to Give"</a> (perhaps by studying computer science in university and then finding a well paid job), or maybe do direct work such as fundraising and movement building. At the moment I’m leaning more towards direct work, but there’s a never ending amount of stuff I want to learn about before I decide, so maybe I’ll change my mind.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> When I think fundraising, I think those annoying people on the street that want me to donate to their political advocacy groups.  Surely that’s not what you’re thinking?  Could you elaborate on the opportunities in fundraising?  Why would you be interested in that?</i>

<b>RD:</b> The kind of fundraising you describe, street fundraising, was the first kind of fundraising I looked into. But as I talk to people more I get the impression that it seems like "major donor fundraising" might be more effective still. Unfortunately I haven’t had much time to research fundraising lately, but I hope to in the future.

Fundraising often has a bad reputation, but I don’t think that this should necessarily be the case. Suppose we’re fundraising for a very effective cause, by doing so it’s possible to multiply the amount of resources at our disposal and thereby do much more good. Fundraising also raises awareness for a cause, so it’s possible to fundraise and build your movement at the same time. You can read the post I <a href="http://www.ruairidonnelly.com/?p=37">originally wrote about fundraising</a>.

However, there are some problems with fundraising, if people donate to your charity instead of a similar one then you’re not creating any "new" donations. However, <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising">more fundraising does create more "new" donors</a>, just maybe not as many as we might have first thought; and by fundraising for a highly effective cause the damage of "taking" money from another cause is reduced.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> How did you get involved with Animal Ethics?  What should someone who wants to get involved with preventing wild animal suffering do?</i>

<b>RD:</b> I had been doing activism involving spreading the ideas of anti-speciesism and reducing wild animal suffering for a while, during which I had made contact with some people who were involved in setting up Animal Ethics.  The more I realised it was a very high impact cause, the more involved I became.  Probably the best thing for someone who is interested in these issues to do is to contact me! My email address is ruairi.donnelly94@gmail.com.  You also could read Brian's <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/wild-animal-volunteering.html">"Ideas for Volunteering to Reduce Wild-Animal Suffering"</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> How did you end up meeting those people?</i>

<b>RD:</b> Through <a href="http://www.felicifia.org">Felicifia</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/">Facebook</a>, and other places where effective altruists gather together.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> In addition to wild animal suffering, you’re also interested in preventing what you call "future suffering".  What is future suffering and how should we go about preventing it?</i>

<b>RD:</b> When people talk about "future suffering" they are usually referring to the unfortunate possibility of large amounts of suffering occurring reasonably far into the future. A lot of these scenarios may initially sound unlikely, and I think that a lot of them are, but given how much is at stake I think some of them are important issues that we should consider carefully. Some common scenarios include:

<b>"Suffering subroutines"</b>, that is, basically the creation of sentient processes in computers which may suffer, they might be used for reinforcement learning or something similar. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0KTUysrwgQ">This video</a> is a visceral example of something similar to this, but in it seems likely that in reality sentient machines might not be made to look similar to us at all.

<b>Sentient simulations.</b> A similar scenario in which humans manage to create sentient simulations of suffering individuals. Imagine "The Sims", except for real... This is also worrying from the point of view of sentient wild animals being simulated, given <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html">how much it seems wild animals suffer</a>.

<b>Spreading suffering wildlife</b> to other planets.

A future controlled by <b><a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html">darwinian forces</a></b>.

The creation of <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/lab-universes.html"><b>lab universes</b></a> which contain a lot of suffering.

<b>Much of the current status quo continues</b>, non-human animals continue suffering horrifically in factory farms, third world poverty and hunger continue, other sources of suffering continue.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
As I said, I think a lot of these are probably quite unlikely, however, perhaps the one I find most worrying, and quite likely too, is that the future will be largely controlled by some unknown unknown factor that we haven’t thought of, sometimes called "Black Swans". The number of future scenarios that get discussed among effective altruists often seem to be very narrow and very inline with the values of those effective altruists. In reality I think we are probably not considering the vast, vast majority of possible futures, and given current human values I think the chance of these futures scenarios containing a lot of suffering is quite high.

People interested in these issues should check out <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=537">this thread</a> and <a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/09/btomasi1/">contact Brian Tomasik</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> Suffering subroutines?  Why should we care about computers?  Do you think they feel pain?</i>

<b>RD:</b> It seems very unlikely that computers currently feel pain, but in the future perhaps humanity will create sentient computers. Already there are efforts to create a <a href="http://www.artificialbrains.com/openworm">simulation of a nematode worm</a> and, on a much more ambitious scale, a <a href="http://io9.com/5980117/new-16-billion-supercomputer-project-will-attempt-to-simulate-the-human-brain">simulation of the human brain</a>.

If sentient computers were created we should definitely care about them. The criteria that distinguishes whether or not we should care about something morally is whether or not it is sentient, whether or not it can feel. That’s why we care about sentient things like people and dogs, but not about non-sentient things.

Luckily some people have started talking about these possibilities and it looks like there will be a lot of exciting work done in this area in the future. Thomas Metzinger, a German philosopher, asks:

<blockquote>What would you say if someone came along and said, "Hey, we want to genetically engineer mentally retarded human infants! For reasons of scientific progress we need infants with certain cognitive and emotional deficits in order to study their postnatal psychological development — we urgently need some funding for this important and innovative kind of research!"

You would certainly think this was not only an absurd and appalling but also a dangerous idea. It would hopefully not pass any ethics committee in the democratic world.

However, what today’s ethics committees don’t see is how the first machines satisfying a minimally sufficient set of constraints for conscious experience could be just like such mentally retarded infants. They would suffer from all kinds of functional and representational deficits too. But they would now also subjectively experience those deficits. In addition, they would have no political lobby — no representatives in any ethics committee.</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> Another comment I’d like to note is that all these scenarios do seem rather unlikely.  Yet you’re preparing for them anyway.  I feel like anyone involved in existential risk does the same -- trying to make an unlikely event even more unlikely.  But why bother, if it’s probably not going to happen?</i>

<b>RD:</b> Some of these scenarios could potentially cause astronomical amounts of suffering to occur, even if we can only change the probability of these scenarios happening slightly, it’s still very important. The future also seems likely to contain many more sentient beings than we can currently aid at the moment, due to the fact that the future stretches out for a very long time in front of us.

However, I do think that some of these scenarios are quite unlikely and also that in general people may only consider a very narrow set of possible futures. Therefore I think it may be a better idea to simply promote values such as anti-speciesism and utilitarianism. Then these values will influence whatever future comes to happen.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> A lot of utilitarians I know like to think really far in the future.  But how do you think we can shape the future?</i>

<b>RD:</b> I think spreading our values might be one of the one of the best ways to improve what the future is likely to be like. Maybe without a handful of utilitarian philosophers who spread their values in the past the entire effective altruist movement would not exist! There are other ways too, such as improving the chance of "in-vitro meat" becoming commercially viable or how quickly it becomes commercially viable. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> Where do you think the "effective altruist" movement is going?  How do you plan to help build it?</i>

<b>RD:</b> I’m hopeful that more people in the effective altruist movement will consider the harms that non-human animals suffer more seriously. 58 billion land animals are killed for human consumption each year, most of these endure horrific lives, and the lower estimate for the number of marine animals killed by humans <a href="http://fishcount.org.uk/fish-welfare-in-commercial-fishing/estimate-of-fish-numbers">is one trillion</a>; the actual number may be much higher.

To be an effective altruist one must take this suffering very seriously. I hope to encourage effective altruists to think more about this suffering, and I hope to build the movement in general. Movement building seems to be a very effective activity due to the fact that the new activists you inspire can go on to inspire more people, I hope to focus on it this year and in the future.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> What is your typical day like right now?  What do you do, if anything, in terms of diet and exercise?</i>

<b>RD:</b> I don't currently have any specific exercise plan, while I was studying I used to take very brief breaks and do body weight exercises every 40 minutes. As well as the benefits of exercise it was useful to take a break from my study. I might continue with this or come up a new plan depending on how long I seem to be able to work without needing a break. As for diet I am vegan. Lately I haven't been eating as healthily as I should, so that's something I will have to change!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> How did you become a vegan?  Was it easy?</i>

<b>RD:</b> I had a conversation with some very effective vegan activists in which I realised that becoming vegan was definitely the right thing to do. I found it quite easy, I think in general people imagine that it will be much more difficult than it really is. And of course the amount of suffering that one prevents by being vegan is absolutely huge in comparison to the occasional inconvenience.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> Do you attempt to convince others to go vegan?  What convincing strategies do you find effective?  What worked on you?</i>

<b>RD:</b> I think it’s important for vegan activists to know their facts and always remain calm. The idea of the "crazy vegan" activist is very common at the moment, I think we definitely need to combat this but at the same time should certainly discuss these issues and try our best to convince people. It’s important to remember that we should pursue whatever strategy will prevent as much suffering as possible, being seen as crazy is probably not how to do this. It may be frustrating that people may not seem to care about causing suffering but being seen as crazy isn’t going to change their minds.

In terms of organizations I think it is absolutely vital that charities measure their impact and constantly try to improve it. If we don’t convince as many people as we can to prevent the harms caused to non-human animals then more needless suffering will occur than if we had been effective in our activism.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> When not saving the world, what fun things do you do in your spare time?</i>

<b>RD:</b> Haha well thank you for implying that I’m saving the world! I try to spend most of my time working on altruistic projects, but I also see my friends and go out dancing at nightclubs quite a lot.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> Some people feel like "saving the world" all the time is too much and they need some balance in their life, so they might give only 10% of their income and 10% of their time, instead of all of it.  What are your thoughts on this balance?</i>

<b>RD:</b> It would be great if we could all work to help others all the time, we would solve problems very quickly! Unfortunately this kind of lifestyle isn't sustainable for most people. Apart from a few real life superheroes I know in the EA movement it doesn't seem possible for people to work all the time, if we burn out and stop working on altruist projects altogether that is a massive loss. So it's important to have fun. Different people have different personalities and each of us will be able to contribute to a different degree. The trick is to find out how much we are personally able for.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>PH:</b> Thank you, Ruairí.  It was great getting to know you better!</i>]]></content:encoded>

Agreed, but isn't talking about future suffering such as sentient computers or sentient simulations an example of being crazy? I mean, for the regular people outside, target of our veganism/reduce-suffering message.]]></wp:comment_content>

				<title>One Week in Oxford</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/one-week-in-oxford/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2013 04:00:02 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/?p=542</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier, I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/off-to-oxford/">mentioned I had flown off to Oxford, England</a> to be a full-time intern for <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>.  Now that I've spent a week here, I'd like to provide some observations about being an American living in British culture.<!--more-->

<b>Two caveats before we begin</b>
1.) This is a little off-topic from the whole "utilitarianism" thing.  Normally, I put off-topic stuff in <a href="http://www.peterhurford.com/writing.html">the writing section</a> of <a href="http://www.peterhurford.com">personal website</a>.  But, by popular demand, it's here instead.

2.) For some of these cases, it's difficult to tell if my remarks are for all of the United Kingdom, or just the Oxford area.  Also, I'm not sure if it's a regional thing (being in more of a city area than a suburb area) or a United Kingdom thing.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now, the observations!

<b>#1: People drive on the wrong side of the road.</b>  This still blows my mind.  It's true that it doesn't matter what side of the road a society drives on as long as everyone agrees.  But the UK is in the minority on this.  Wikipedia has <a href="">a surprisingly lengthy article on left- and right-hand traffic</a>, noting that "about 72% of the world's total road distance carries traffic on the right [American style] and 28% on the left [UK style]".  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Countries_driving_on_the_left_or_right.svg">Here's a handy map.</a>

<b>#2: The steering wheel is on the wrong side of the car.</b>  Also blows my mind.  It's strange to be looking at a car and think you're looking at the passenger, when actually you're looking at the driver.  Even weirder when at first glance the car has no driver!

<b>#3: They use the metric system, but this comes up surprisingly infrequently.</b>  Most people talk about the temperature, but I'm already used to Celsius as a more sensible temperature system.  The only other time I've needed to think about metric is when stepping on a scale.

<b>#4: They speak English, <i>sort of</i>.</b>  British people use less slang than I expected, but I still don't understand quite a few phrases.  "Wheat bread" is "brown bread", "sun screen" is "sun cream", "power cut" instead of "power failure", etc.  It's like they have a secret codebook of phrases, and I'm not invited.

<b>#5: The comparison between Oxford and New York was greatly exaggerated.</b>  I still haven't seen anything here taller than four stories.

<b>#6: Everyone bikes.</b> This is kind of like New York, except even more so.  Biking is, by far, the most common method of transportation.  I like that.

<b>#7: The outlet is weird.</b>  British electrical outlets <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BS_1363">look like this</a>, as compared to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEMA_connector#NEMA_5">American ones</a>.  At least it's not the Danish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_outlet#Danish_Section_107-2-D1_.2810.2F13.2F16.C2.A0A.2F250.C2.A0V_earthed.29.28Type_K.29">smiley-face plug</a>.]]></content:encoded>

If the article headline contains the word "gaffe", ends in a question mark, contains the word "blasts", says something is a "blow to" someone else's plans, or is about a lawmaker saying something really stupid, you shouldn't put much stock in the article.

Giving What We Can <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-06-18/interview-with-peter-singer-part-i">interviews Peter Singer</a> on effective altruism.

A comical take on <a href="http://www.jewcy.com/post/the_other_day_i_gave_1000_to_american_idol_and_you_youre_just_a_piece_of_trash">why it might not be so bad to brag about donations</a>.  I wrote about this in <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/to-inspire-people-to-give-be-public-about-your-giving/">"To Inspire People to Give, Be Public About Your Giving"</a>.<!--more-->

Some people complain that social science can't accomplish good things for society or is not rigorous enough to demonstrate anything.  Choices Magazine addresses both issues by <a href="http://www.choicesmagazine.org/magazine/article.php?article=87">showing how behavioral economics can be used to steer people</a> toward healthier choices in the cafeteria.  For one example, swapping candy at the cash register for fruit lead to healthier impulse purchases while not declining cafeteria revenue.  Other examples in the essay are more intriguing.

Scientists had previously used the "marshmellow test" where young children are given one marshmellow and allowed to eat it, but told that if they don't, they will get three marshmellows in the future.  The children who opt to wait and get the three marshmellows are typically considered to be better at "delayed gratification" and "self-control" and have better life outcomes.  But <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/lesswrong/lw/hw6/a_new_interpretation_of_the_marshmallow_test/">a new interpretation shows</a> that perhaps they just come from a more trusting environment and believe adults will actually fulfill their promise of more marshmellows.

People tend to like things that share the same initial as their name.  This fact might be surprising, but did you also think <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/04/01/smart-hurricane-names-a-policy-intervention-that-costs-almost-nothing-but-should-attract-billions-of-dollars-in-aid/">it would have startling implications for naming hurricanes</a>?  People also donate more to hurricane relief for hurricanes that share their initials -- Roberts, Ralphs and Roses donated on average 260% more to the Hurricane Rita relief fund than did people without R initials.  So why don't we just make sure hurricanes are more frequently named after common initials, like "J" or "M"?

You might know Daniel Kahneman and his book <b><a href="">Thinking: Fast and Slow</a></b> which outlines <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/12/michael-lewis-201112">our use of mental heuristics that can fail</a>.  But <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2011/12/kahneman-quiz-201112">can you pass his quiz of questions</a> that involve these heuristics?

<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/04/why-the-rich-dont-give/309254/">Why do the rich give less than the poor</a>, as a percentage of their income?  A couple of reasons are explored -- exposure to money drives greed and exposure to need drives generosity.

We have <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/03/our_internet_su.html">an internet surveillance state</a> -- "all of us being watched, all the time, and that data being stored forever."

				<title>Introducing Effective Fundraising, a New EA Org</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people know about GiveWell and <a href="http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">their top-ranked charities</a>.  But how easy would it be to make a better one?  In <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/03/why-it-should-be-easy-to-dominate-givewells-recommendations.html">"Why It Should Be Easy to Dominate GiveWell's Recommendations"</a>, Rob Wiblin notes the simple solution -- fundraise for whatever organizations GiveWell recommends, and raise more than a dollar with each dollar you receive.

Organizations themselves <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising">are wary of fundraising</a>, mainly because spending a lot of resources on fundraising messes with their "overhead ratio" or percentage of funds spent directly on the mission.  Even if an organization could achieve gains through fundraising, it's outweighed by "looking bad".  So ideally, we'd need other people to come together and create an organization that does full-time fundraising for other organizations.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Luckily, an organization has been founded to do just that.  Joey Savoie, Xiomara Kikauka, and Lucas Zamprogno have come together to create <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/">Effective Fundraising</a> an organization that provides free fundraising to charities with a proven track record of effectiveness, as ranked by <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>, or <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org">Effective Animal Activism</a>.  Currently, <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/our-charity-choice.html">they're fundraising for</a> both the <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.thehumaneleague.com/">The Humane League</a>, both of which don't do any grant fundraising themselves.

Not only that, but they fundraise using the most effective methods that has been proven by studies -- grant writing and high net worth fundraising.  The <a href="http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/research/fundratios/">UK Institute of Fundraising</a> estimates that grant writing returns, on average, $7 for every $1 invested and focusing on high net worth giving can get average returns of $4 for every $1 invested.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0471320145"><b>Fund Raising: Evaluating and Managing the Fund Development Process</a></b> states that these two are the highest return fundraising campaigns, with a return of $10 and $5 per $1 invested respectively.

You can read more about <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/07/our-values.html">their values</a>, <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/07/our-epistemology.html">their epistemology</a>, and <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/07/our-strategy.html">strategy</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/05/why-fundraising.html">why they're interested in fundraising</a> on <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/">their website</a>.

They're still in the "proof of concept" phase and are not currently actively seeking funding, but they seem like a promising opportunity to keep an eye on for the future.

				<title>Why I&#039;m Skeptical About Unproven Causes (And You Should Be Too)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since living in Oxford, one of the centers of the "effective altruism" movement, I've been spending a lot of time discussing the classic “effective altruism” topic -- where it would be best to focus our time and money.

Some people here seem to think that the most important thing we should be focusing our time and money on are speculative projects, or projects that promise a very high impact, but involve a lot of uncertainty.  One such very common example is "existential risk reduction", or attempts to make a long-term far future for humans more likely, say by reducing the chance of things that would cause human extinction.

I do agree that the far future is the most important thing to consider, by far (see papers by <a href="http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf">Nick Bostrom</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research">Nick Beckstead</a>).  And I do think we can influence the far future.  I just don't think we can do it in a <i>reliable</i> way.  All we have are guesses about what the far future will be like and guesses about how we can affect it. All of these ideas are unproven, speculative projects, and I don't think they deserve the main focus of our funding.

While I waffled in cause indecision for a while, I'm now going to resume donating to <a href="http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell's top charities</a>, except when I have an opportunity to use a donation to learn more about impact.  Why?  My case is that speculative causes, or any cause with high uncertainty (reducing nonhuman animal suffering, reducing existential risk, etc.) requires that we rely on our commonsense to evaluate them with naīve cost-effectiveness calculations, and this is (1) demonstrably unreliable with a bad track record, (2) plays right into common biases, and (3) doesn’t make sense based on how we ideally make decisions.  While it’s unclear what long-term impact a donation to a GiveWell top charity will have, the near-term benefit is quite clear and worth investing in.<!--more-->

<h2>Focusing on Speculative Causes Requires Unreliable Commonsense</h2>
How can we reduce the chance of human extinction? It just makes sense that if we fund cultural exchange programs between the US and China, there will be more goodwill for the other within each country, and therefore the countries will be less likely to nuke each other. Since nuclear war would likely be very bad, it's of high value to fund cultural exchange programs, right?

Let's try another. The <a href="http://intelligence.org/">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> (MIRI) thinks that someday artificial intelligent agents will become better than humans at making AIs. At this point, AI will build a smarter AI which will build an even smarter AI, and -- FOOM! -- we have a superintelligence. It's important that this superintelligence be programmed to be benevolent, or things will likely be very bad. And we can stop this bad event by funding MIRI to <a href="http://intelligence.org/research/">write more papers about AI</a>, right?

Or how about this one? It seems like there will be challenges in the far future that will be very daunting, and if humanity handles them wrong, things will be very bad. But if people were better educated and had more resources, surely they'd be better at handling those problems, whatever they may be. Therefore we should focus on speeding up economic development, right?

These three examples are very common appeals to commonsense.  But commonsense hasn't worked very well in the domain of finding optimal causes.
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Can You Pick the Winning Social Program?</h4>
Benjamin Todd makes this point well in <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/66-social-interventions-gone-wrong">"Social Interventions Gone Wrong"</a>, where he provides a quiz with eight social programs and asks readers to guess whether they succeeded or failed.

<i>I'll wait for you to take the quiz first... doo doo doo... la la la...</i>

Ok, welcome back. I don't know how well you did, but success on this quiz is very rare, and this poses problems for commonsense.  Sure, I'll grant you that Scared Straight sounds pretty suspicious. But the Even Start Family Literacy Program? It just makes sense that providing education to boost literacy skills and promote parent-child literacy activities should boost literacy rates, right? Unfortunately, it was wrong. Wrong in a very counter-intuitive way. There wasn't an effect.  

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>GiveWell and Commonsense's Track Record of Failure</h4>
Commonsense actually has a track record of failure. GiveWell has been talking about this for ages.  Every time GiveWell has found an intervention hyped by commonsense notions of high-impact and they've looked at it further, they've ended up disappointed.

<b>The first was the Fred Hollows Foundation.</b> A lot of people had been repeating the figure that the Fred Hollows Foundation could cure blindness for $50. But GiveWell <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2008/07/21/preventing-blindness/">found that number suspect</a>.

<b>The second was VillageReach.</b> GiveWell originally put them as their top charity and estimated them as <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/villagereach/December-2009-review#Whatdoyougetforyourdollar">saving a life for under $1000</a>. But further investigation kept leading them to revise their estimate until ultimately they <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2012/07/26/rethinking-villagereachs-pilot-project/">weren't even sure if VillageReach had an impact at all</a>.

<b>Third, there is deworming.</b> Originally, deworming was announced as saving a year of healthy life (DALY) for every $3.41 spent. But when GiveWell dove into the spreadsheets that resulted in that number, they <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2011/09/29/errors-in-dcp2-cost-effectiveness-estimate-for-deworming/ ">found five errors</a>. When the dust settled, the $3.41 figure was found to actually be off by a factor of 100. It was revised to $326.43.

Why shouldn't we expect this trend to not be the case in other areas where calculations are even looser and numbers are even less settled, like efforts devoted to speculative causes? Our only recourse is to fall back on interventions that are actually studied.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>People Are Notoriously Bad At Predicting the (Far) Future</h4>
Cost-effectiveness estimates also frequently require making predictions about the future. Existential risk reduction, for example, requires making predictions about what will happen in the far future, and how your actions are likely to effect events hundreds of years down the road. Yet, experts are notoriously bad at making these kinds of predictions.

James Shanteau found in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/074959789290064E">"Competence in Experts: The Role of Task Characteristics"</a> (see also Kahneman and Klein's <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/64/6/515/">"Conditions for Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree"</a>) that experts perform well when thinking about static stimuli, thinking about things, and when there is feedback and objective analysis available. Furthermore, experts perform pretty badly when thinking about dynamic stimuli, thinking about behavior, and feedback and objective analysis are unavailable.

Predictions about existential risk reduction and the far future are firmly in the second category. So how can we trust our predictions about our impact on the far future? Our only recourse is to fall back on interventions that we can reliably predict, until we get better at prediction (or invest money in getting better at making predictions).
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Even Broad Effects Require Specific Attempts</h4>
One potential resolution to this problem is to argue for “broad effects” rather than “specific attempts”.  Perhaps it’s difficult to know whether a particular intervention will go well or mistaken to focus entirely on Friendly AI, but surely if we improved incentives and norms in academic work to better advance human knowledge (meta-research), improved education, or advocated for effective altruism, the far future would be much better equipped to handle threats.

I agree that these broad effects would make the far future better and I agree that it’s possible to implement these broad effects and change the far future.  The problem, however, is it can’t be done in an easy or well understood way.  Any attempt to implement a broad effect would require a specific action that has an unknown expectation of success and unknown cost-effectiveness.  It’s definitely beneficial to advocate for effective altruism, but could this be done in a cost-effective way?  A way that’s more cost-effective at producing welfare than AMF?  How would you know?

In order to accomplish these broad effects, you’d need specific organizations and interventions to channel your time and money into.  And by picking these specific organizations and interventions, you’re losing the advantage of broad effects and tying yourself to particular things with poorly understood impact and no track record to evaluate. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Focusing on Speculative Causes Plays Into Our Biases</h2>
We've now known for quite a long time that people are not all that rational. Instead, human thinking fails in very predictable and systematic ways.  Some of these ways make us less likely to take speculative causes seriously, such as ambiguity aversion, the absurdity heuristic, scope neglect, and overconfidence bias.

But there’s also a different side of the coin, with biases that might make people think badly about existential risk:

<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias">Optimism bias</a>.</b> People generally think things will turn out better than they actually will. This could lead people to think that their projects will have a higher impact than they actually will, which would lead to higher estimates of cost-effectiveness than is reasonable.

<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control">Control bias</a>.</b> People like to think they have more control over things than they actually do. This plausibly also includes control over the far future. Therefore, people are probably biased into thinking they have more control over the far future than they actually do, leading to higher estimates of ability to influence the future than is reasonable.

<b>"Wow factor" bias.</b> People seem attracted to more impressive claims. Saving a life for $2500 through a malaria bed net seems much more boring compared to the chance of saving the entire world by averting a global catastrophe. Within the effective altruist / LessWrong community, existential risk reduction is cool and high status, whereas averting global poverty is not. This might lead to more endorsement of existential risk reduction than is reasonable.

<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy">Conjunction fallacy</a>.</b>  People have a problem assessing probability properly when there are many steps involved, each of which has a chance of not happening. Ten steps, each with an independent 90% success rate, has only a 35% chance of success.  Focusing on the far future seems to involve that a lot of largely independent events happen the way that is predicted. This would mean people are worse at estimating their chances of helping the far future, creating higher cost-effectiveness estimates than is reasonable.

<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias">Selection bias</a>.</b>  When trying to find trends in history that are favorable for affecting the far future, some examples can be provided.  However, this is because we usually hear about the interventions that end up working, whereas all the failed attempts to influence the far future are never heard of again.  This creates a very skewed sample that can negatively bias our thinking about our success of influencing the far future.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
It’s concerning there are numerous biases both weighted in favor and weighted against speculative causes, and this means we must tread carefully when assessing their merits.  However, I would strongly expect biases to be even worse in favor of speculative causes rather than against them, because speculative causes lack the available feedback and objective evidence needed to help insulate against bias, whereas a focus on global health does not.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Focusing on Speculative Causes Uses Bad Decision Theory</h2>
Furthermore, not only is the case for speculative causes undermined by a bad track record and possible cognitive biases, but the underlying decision theory seems suspect in a way that's difficult to place.         

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Would you play a lottery with no stated odds?</h4>
Imagine another thought experiment -- you're asked to play a lottery. You have to pay $2 to play, but you have a chance at winning $100. Do you play?

Of course, you don't know, because you're not given odds. Rationally, it makes sense to play any lottery where you expect to come out ahead more often than not. If the lottery is a coin flip, it makes sense to pay $2 to have a 50/50 shot to win $100, since you'd expect to win $50 on average, and come ahead $48 each time. With a sufficiently high reward, even a one in a million chance is worth it. Pay $2 for a 1/1M chance of winning $1B, and you'd expect to come out ahead by $998 each time.

But $2 for the chance to win $100, without knowing what the chance is? Even if you had some sort of bounds, like you knew the odds had to be at least 1/150 and at most 1/10, though you could be off by a little bit. Would you accept that bet?

Such a bet seems intuitively uninviting to me, yet this is the bet that speculative causes offer me.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>"Conservative Orders of Magnitude" Arguments</h4>
In response to these considerations, I've seen people endorsing speculative causes look at their calculations and remark that even if their estimate were off by 1000x, or three orders of magnitude, they still would be on solid ground for high impact, and there's no way they're actually off by three orders of magnitude. However, Nate Silver's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/159420411X"><b>The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail — but Some Don't</b></a> offers a cautionary tale:

<blockquote>Moody’s, for instance, went through a period of making ad hoc adjustments to its model in which it increased the default probability assigned to AAA-rated securities by 50 percent. That might seem like a very prudent attitude: surely a 50 percent buffer will suffice to account for any slack in one’s assumptions? It might have been fine had the potential for error in their forecasts been linear and arithmetic. But leverage, or investments financed by debt, can make the error in a forecast compound many times over, and introduces the potential of highly geometric and nonlinear mistakes.

Moody’s 50 percent adjustment was like applying sunscreen and claiming it protected you from a nuclear meltdown—wholly inadequate to the scale of the problem. It wasn’t just a possibility that their estimates of default risk could be 50 percent too low: they might just as easily have underestimated it by 500 percent or 5,000 percent. In practice, defaults were two hundred times more likely than the ratings agencies claimed, meaning that their model was off by a mere 20,000 percent.</blockquote>

Silver points out that when estimating how safe mortgage backed securities were, the difference between assuming defaults are perfectly uncorrelated and defaults are perfectly correlated is a difference of 160,000x in your risk estimate -- or five orders of magnitude.

If these kinds of five-orders-of-magnitude errors are possible in a realm that has actual feedback and is moderately understood, how do we know the estimates for cost-effectiveness are safe for speculative causes that are poorly understood and offer no feedback?  Again, our only recourse is to fall back on interventions that we can reliably predict, until we get better at prediction.
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Value of Information, Exploring, and Exploiting</h2>
Of course, there still is one important aspect of this problem that has not been discussed -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information">value of information</a> -- or the idea that sometimes it’s worth doing something just to learn more about how the world works.  This is important in effective altruism too, where we focus specifically on “giving to learn”, or using our resources to figure out more about the impact of various causes.

I think this is actually really important and is not a victim to any of my previous arguments, because we’re not talking about impact, but rather learning value.  Perhaps one could look to an “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">explore-exploit model</a>”, or the idea that we achieve the best outcome when we spend a lot of time exploring first (learning more about how to achieve better outcomes) before exploiting (focusing resources on achieving the best outcome we can).  Therefore, whenever we have an opportunity to “explore” further or learn more about what causes have high impact, we should take it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Learning in Practice</h4>
Unfortunately, in practice, I think these opportunities are very rare.  Many organizations that I think are “promising” and worth funding further to see what their impact looks like do not have sufficiently good self-measurement in place to actually assess their impact or sufficient transparency to provide that information, therefore making it difficult to actually learn from them.  And on the other side of things, many very promising opportunities to learn more are already fully funded.  One must be careful to ensure that it’s actually one’s marginal dollar that is getting marginal information.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Typical Donor</h4>
Additionally, I don’t think the typical donor is in a very good position to assess where there is high value of information or have the time and knowledge to act upon this information once it is acquired.  I think there’s a good argument for people in the “effective altruist” movement to perhaps make small investments in EA organizations and encourage transparency and good measurement in their operations to see if they’re successfully doing what they claim (or potentially create an EA startup themselves to see if it would work, though this carries large risks of further splitting the resources of the movement).

But even that would take a very savvy and involved effective altruist to pull off.  Assessing the value of information on more massive investments like large-scale research or innovation efforts would be significantly more difficult, beyond the talent and resources of nearly all effective altruists, and are probably left to full-time foundations or subject-matter experts.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>GiveWell’s Top Charities Also Have High Value of Information</h4>
As Luke Muehlhauser mentions in <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hsd/start_under_the_streetlight_then_push_into_the/">“Start Under the Streetlight, Then Push Into the Shadows”</a>, lots of lessons can be learned only by focusing on the easiest causes first, even if we have strong theoretical reasons to expect that they won’t end up being the highest impact causes once we have more complete knowledge.

We can use global health cost-effectiveness considerations as practice for slowly and carefully moving into the more complex and less understood domains.  There even are some very natural transitions, such as beginning to look at “<a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/">flow through effects</a>” of reducing disease in the third-world and beginning to look at how more esoteric things affect the disease burden, like climate change.  Therefore, even additional funding for GiveWell’s top charities has high value of information.  And notably, GiveWell is beginning this “push” through <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/category/givewell-labs/">GiveWell Labs</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The bottom line is that sometimes things look too good to be true.  Therefore, I should expect that the actual impact of speculative causes that make large promises, upon a thorough investigation, will be much lower.

And this has been true in other domains. People are notoriously bad at estimating the effects of causes in both the developed world and developing world, and those are the causes that are near to us, provide us with feedback, and are easy to predict. Yet, from the Even Start Family Literacy Program to deworming estimates, our commonsense has failed us.

Add to that the fact that we should expect ourselves to perform even worse at predicting the far future. Add to that optimism bias, control bias, "wow factor" bias, and the conjunction fallacy, which make it difficult for us to think realistically about speculative causes. And then add to that considerations in decision theory, and whether we would bet on a lottery with no stated odds.

When all is said and done, I'm very skeptical of speculative projects.  Therefore, I think we should be focused on exploring and exploiting.  We should do whatever we can to fund projects aimed at learning more, when those are available, but be careful to make sure they actually have learning value.  And when exploring isn’t available, we should exploit what opportunities we have and fund proven interventions.

But don’t confuse these two concepts and fund causes intended for learning because of their actual impact value.  I’m skeptical about these causes actually being high impact, though I’m open to the idea that they might be and look forward to funding them in the future when they become better proven.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think all claims surrounding the poor meat eater problem are going to be weak.  There's some evidence that people eat more meat as their income rises and there's some evidence that this meat will be factory farmed, but neither of it is super solid (though, I agree, I think it's good enough to warrant concern).

This gets even worse when you're trying to extrapolate what will happen on the margin -- will, specifically, saving someone from malaria cause enough increase in meat consumption to weaken or cancel the upside substantially enough to care?

Basically, what we're doing here is running <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hmb/many_weak_arguments_vs_one_relatively_strong/" rel="nofollow">multiple weak arguments</a> against each other.  On one hand, you have the meat eating - income correlation and the developing world factory farming trend.

But on the other hand, you have the considerations that...

(a) By the time most people saved from malaria will have enough money to eat meat in significant quantities, it will be several decades or more into the future.

(b) Intentional meat reduction in the standard American diet is on the rise.  Even vegetarianism and veganism are on the rise, but much less so.  I expect that in several decades, this will be a wider trend that could also be ported to the developing world.

(c) The ability to convince people to become vegetarian and veganism, and the institutions necessary to make these tactics widespread, is just beginning to get more sophisticated.  This could also get ported to the developing world.

(d) Meat substitutes that taste nearly like meat are getting significantly more sophisticated.  This would reduce the demand for actual meat in the developing world.

(e) In vitro meat is getting closer to mass market production.  This too would reduce the demand for actual meat in the developed world.

The bottom line is that my position isn't that we need large quantities of evidence to make decisions, as that would be overly paralyzing.  Though lacking quality evidence in this area is enough to make me moderately uncertain about the poor meat eater problem, the available considerations we do have point pretty clearly toward it not being an issue, and there's minimal defeating reason to think poorly of these considerations (there aren't suspicions of bias, and our inability to predict the future applies equally to both sides).]]></wp:comment_content>

How does this relate to your rejection of the poor meat-eater problem? A couple of weeks ago you explained to me why you don't believe that the poor meat-eater problem is a problem. If I recall correctly, you essentially said that people in the future will probably care about animal welfare, so it's okay to harm animals more now because it will work out in the long run.

This justification requires assuming a fact for which there exists very little evidence, i.e. that people in the future will care significantly about animal welfare. Based on the reasoning given in this post, shouldn't you reject your rejection of the poor meat-eater problem?

Apologies if I have misunderstood your position.]]></wp:comment_content>

However, donating is still widely considered an individual affair, despite criticism<sup>1</sup>.

So why would people want to join together and make their giving public?  Because it turns out there is value in joining together and creating a community around a common cause.  In this essay, I will explore the benefits that members of a community get from associating with a group, specifically focusing on Giving What We Can.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Power of Groups</h2>
Writing in his book <u>Politics</u>, Aristotle noted that people are social animals.  Since then, much evidence from social psychology has been marshaled to back him up.  People have a tendency to form groups with common causes<sup>2</sup>, and frequently adopt the group as part of their personal identity<sup>3</sup> even to the point of thinking like the group<sup>4</sup> and assuming the group thinks like them<sup>5</sup>.  The power of a group is considered so strong that joining has typically been categorized as a fundamental human need<sup>3,6</sup>.

But people don't stop there.  Those who associate with a group will also act to benefit their own group at an individual cost to themselves<sup>7</sup>, typically developing an "in-group / out-group" bias in their thinking<sup>8,9,10</sup> and sometimes going as far as seeing groups with opposing missions as a direct threat<sup>11</sup>.  Many people even derive their self-identity from the values of their group, placing large amounts of value and emotional significance on group membership<sup>12</sup>.

By forming a community, people can group together to accomplish goals that no individual could do on their own, and having a strong group identity is fundamental to doing a joint job well<sup>13</sup>.  Communities are what built Wikipedia and Linux, and each tries to create identity and norms.  By joining Giving What We Can, members endorse the values of the organization and put on a public face to spread their message to others in a coordinated way that they wouldn't be able to alone.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Peer Pressure in Groups</h2>
Countless examples exist of people coming together with a common objective of doing something hard, yet rewarding, and groups are an excellent place to do that -- to keep everyone on task and motivated.  Perhaps the most famous example is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous">Alcoholics Anonymous</a>, founded in 1935 to create a group to support each other in staying sober.  However, while AA hasn't yet been demonstrated effective or ineffective due to methodological flaws<sup>14</sup>, another similar group demonstrates the ability of groups to curb behavior -- Weight Watchers<sup>15</sup>, a comprehensive diet plan that includes group support.

When people associate with a group, members of that group become the reference point for social comparison, and people continue to adopt in-group attitudes and beliefs as their own<sup>16,17</sup>, especially when information comes from group members perceived to have expertise<sup>18</sup> and especially when the group in question has positive values<sup>19</sup>.  Thus, getting someone to join a group with a strong identity of "my kind of people act <i>this</i> way" is one of the more effective ways to inspire behavioral change, and typically the justification for this change will come later<sup>20,21</sup>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Peer Pressure for the Common Good</h2>
Peer pressure can be dangerous -- by falling into the wrong group identities, high school kids end up abusing drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and stand an increased chance of dropping out<sup>22</sup>.  However, peer pressure can also be beneficial -- by falling into the right group identities, high school kids will be less likely to cheat<sup>23</sup>.

Many members of Giving What We Can were already committed to giving large portions of their income to charity before joining.  However, just by being in the group, one is more likely to keep giving, and stay giving longer than one otherwise would without access to such a community.

In a group with a defined level of contribution, members will feel a social pressure to exert this level of effort<sup>24</sup>.  I think, given the benefits of donating to effective non-profits to those in extreme poverty, it's uncontroversial to describe membership in Giving What We Can as "peer pressure for the common good".  Assuming members want to stay committed to this cause, joining Giving What We Can is a great way to make use of this peer pressure effect to stay a giver.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
Lastly, joining together in a group like Giving What We Can allows people to present a unified voice of advocacy and also gives them the encouragement needed to stay motivated.  But Giving What We Can also allows people to share information and come to better decisions.  Membership involves a commitment to find the best opportunity for helping alleviate extreme poverty and <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities">provides recommendations</a> to help out.

However, extreme poverty is complex, and lots of new information and research comes out every day.  It takes a lot to stay on top of it, and it would be difficult to expect any one person to do all of it on their own.  Luckily, they don't have to.  People can share research and other relevant information with a community and distribute the work, thus ensuring everyone stays on top of the latest trends.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Having a community publicly surround the cause of effective giving provides many benefits to those receiving the donation.  However, a community can help those within the community as well:

(1) It can provide a public face for better understanding and advocacy,
(2) It can provide peer support to keep people motivated and engaged, and
(3) It can provide a place to network and share information

Hopefully, Giving What We Can and related "effective altruist" organizations will grow and more people interested in helping those in extreme poverty will join up, making us all stronger together.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/21/a-defense-of-logical-positivism-yes-really/">"A Defense of Logical Positivism (Yes, Really)"</a>.  I've always kind of thought like this.  Goes along with <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/k2/a_priori/">this take on a priori reasoning</a>.

<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/awm/how_to_avoid_dying_in_a_car_crash/">"How to Avoid Dying in a Car Crash"</a>.  This is important, because it's one of the highest causes of death for developed-world people aged 15-24, like me.  The tips?  (1) Don't be overconfident; (2) don't be distracted by phones, scenery, fatigue, or other passengers; (3) don't speed; (4) avoid driving at night, during snow, or during rain; and the obvious stuff like (5) don't drink alcohol and (6) wear your seatbelt.  Also... <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2012-09-23">car helmets</a>?

<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html">"Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas"</a> (about start-ups).  Generally, the problems are getting too excited and not putting in sufficient amount of time (i.e. weeks) in challenging the general idea behind your start-up, not wanting to do the un-fun parts of the job, and being too timid / risk-averse.

As Dan Gilbert points out <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html">in his TED Talk</a>, our beliefs about what will make us happy are often wrong.  It turns out we can adapt and find happiness in even some of the worst situations.  Hilarity ensues.

				<title>In Non-Profits, Who Is The Customer?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For-profit organizations (better known as <i>businesses</i>) are in many ways much more simple than non-profit organizations.  When it comes to a pizza place, their goal is to sell me a delicious cheese pizza for $12.95 and my goal is to find the most delicious cheese pizza I can with my $12.95.  When our goals overlap, I give them my money and they give me their pizza.

<b>For businesses, knowing you are successful is also easy</b> -- the critical metric of profit is hitting the business in the face every time the cash register opens, and it's easy to document whether it's going up or down.  We can tell if a business is successful just by looking at these numbers, and we have no need for <a href="http://denisonvpc.wordpress.com/2012/06/15/just-how-do-we-know-if-a-non-profit-is-effective-anyway/">randomized controlled trials</a> to see if making pizza is <i>really</i> the cause of profit, or if a pizza place could remain profitable without selling anything.

<b>Also for businesses, you are automatically accountable for failure.</b>  In bigger companies, you get fired by your shareholders.  Or, you simply stop finding yourself having enough money to pay salaries and keep the place open.  If your product isn't serving it's customers, you quickly go out of business.  You don't have to notice if you're doing bad, because doing badly will just catch up with you.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Non-Profits Are Not Businesses</h2>
Very little of this is true in non-profit organizations.  David Damberger is an engineer in <a href="http://www.ewb-usa.org/">Engineers Without Borders</a>.  He was tired of working on engineering printers to print at an extra two pages per minute, and instead wanted to work on projects that mattered, like ensuring that everyone had access to clean water.

However, Damberger explains in his TEDTalk entitled <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/david_damberger_what_happens_when_an_ngo_admits_failure.html">"What Happens When An NGO Admits Failure"</a>, that this mission of clean water has not been successful.  It's sad to hear that many water projects were developed to bring water, but then broke down barely two years later due to no-one to maintain them.  Then, instead of coming to fix these old water projects, organizations would just build entirely new projects from scratch, and these would also break down just two years later.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
But why do non-profits regularly fail?  In short, its because they aren't businesses:

<b>In non-profits, unlike business, knowing you are successful is hard.</b> It's easy to see if you're making a pizza people will buy, but it's hard to see if you're closing the achievement gap, or lowering poverty.  Things like these are impacted by many different factors, impact takes awhile to show up, and if it does, it's hard to know if it was <i>your particular program</i> -- or even any program, and not just statistical noise.  If you're succeeding or failing, these problems are so complex and poorly understood that it's hard (but <a href="http://denisonvpc.wordpress.com/2012/06/15/just-how-do-we-know-if-a-non-profit-is-effective-anyway/">not impossible</a>) to know.

<b>Likewise, non-profits are not automatically accountable to failure.</b> Businesses get money from those who use their services, but non-profits get money from people who do not use their services.  Money comes from donors, but products are given to others, such as the disadvantaged students or the extremely poor -- and these people may lack the knowledge or resources to communicate how things are doing.  Furthermore, donors don't get the first-hand experience of whether things are going better, but have to rely on communications from non-profits in the form of mailings.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Non-profits have trouble being accountable because their success is hard to measure, and they don't get money from the people who they provide for.  The customer for a for-profit business is clear -- it's the buyer.  I give them the $12.95 they want, and they give me the pizza I want.

<b>In the non-profit world, there are two different pools of customers</b> -- the people in need (beneficiaries) who receive help from the non-profit organization, and the donors who fund the non-profit activities.  These two customer pools don't overlap, it's the beneficiaries who are in the best position to know what they need, but the donors who keep the organizations accountable through funding.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Non-Profits Cannot Be Businesses</h2>
The obvious solution to this problem would be to turn non-profits into businesses.  But this would be a case where the obvious is wrong, <b>because non-profits cannot be businesses.</b>  While businesses <a href="http://denisonvpc.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/theres-giving-and-theres-strategic-giving/">can do much to contribute to social causes related to their field</a>, nearly every charitable goal is long-term and not something from which any profit can be made.  Instead, <a href="http://denisonvpc.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/the-failures-of-foreign-aid-and-some-potential-fixes/">one would expect to spend trillions of dollars</a> without getting any monetary return for centuries.  That's why charitable causes are for charities that are motivated by <i>social returns</i>, not those looking to make a quick buck.

But there are a couple solutions that could bring more accountability to the non-profit world and break out of the cycle of development failure.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Be A Savvier Donor</h4>
Damberger points to non-profits who focus on having little overhead costs.  This creates the attractive message that every dollar  donated goes directly to helping those in need, but it means that critical things aren't being funded, like maintenance.  Why focus on having little overhead instead of funding what is needed to actually help in a sustainable way?  Well, because donors currently don't want that, and the only things that go forward are what people are willing to fund.

Non-profits are directly accountable to their donors -- and it is only the donors who can ensure money is put to effective programs.  Thus, donors have to use this responsibility wisely, and not fall into common traps like "little overhead" that perpetuate unsustainability and waste.

Engineers Without Borders has taken this and pushed back against this with a motto "It's not sexy, but it works".  The most effective organizations aren't always the ones with the most compelling, heart-wrenching stories.  Instead, the charitable causes are often won by boring things, like statistics.  No one said giving effectively would be easy.  But, with organizations like Engineers Without Borders, <a href="http://denisonvpc.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/giving-is-hard-but-theres-help/">there is help</a>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Failure: Admit, Embrace, and Learn</h4>
Demberger talks about a lack of coordination within the development community, and a failure to learn from failure.  Hiding failure (because it might upset donors) results in these failures being unknowingly repeated again and again, potentially <a href="http://denisonvpc.wordpress.com/2012/06/21/the-gray-of-social-change/">harming rather than helping</a>.  At the same time, the scariness of failure makes non-profits risk-adverse, and thus puts pressure to maintain the status quo, potentially reinforcing already failed methods.

Demberger and others set up <a href="http://www.admittingfailure.com">AdmittingFailure.com</a> in order to document failures in the development world, and ensure "that we learn from failures instead of repeat them — that we are failing forward".  The website allows people to publish and discuss stories about failures, and then embrace them and learn from them.

As the website <a href="http://www.admittingfailure.com/about/why/">puts it</a>:

<blockquote><span>By admitting our failures, we end failure cycles and begin a linear progression of failing forward. It’s why this site exists. We’re on the same side, if not the same team. We’re working towards a common goal. By sharing what doesn’t work, we collectively accelerate the process of finding what does.</span></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Social Impact Bonds</h4>
Lastly, another interesting way to bring more accountability to non-profits is a pay-for-success model known as "Social Impact Bonds".  Tina Rosenberg, writing for the Fixes Column article <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/the-promise-of-social-impact-bonds/?nl=opinion&amp;emc=edit_ty_20120620">"The Promise of Social Impact Bonds"</a>.

Here's the model.  First, raise a couple million dollars from investors to fund a social program.  If the social program does not meet its target, the investors don't get any money back.  But if the social program meets its target, the state government pays the investors back all their funds plus interest, with more interest depending on how much the program beats its target.

Best yet, the targets for success will be tied to hard-to-measure numbers that actually matter (in this example, recidivism rates of prisoners who receive councilling, nut just the number of people who enter the program), and control for common biases (like sampling effects).

By getting these measures out there in front of the non-profits, and making sure that the non-profits only get funded if they succeed on these metrics, the accountability is greatly increased...

...kind of like a business.  Except, with savvy donors who embrace failure and focus on long-term social change.  Perhaps while they eat a pizza.

				<title>Don&#039;t Call Us a Charitable-Industrial Complex</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/dont-call-us-a-charitable-industrial-complex/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A key question we at Giving What We Can ask ourselves is “how can we make the world a better place?” Currently, we think the best opportunity to do good is to donate <a href="www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">to one of GiveWell's recommended charities</a>.

Peter Buffett, a son of noted billionaire philanthropist Warren Buffett, weighed in on his ideas in his new New York Times op-ed, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/opinion/the-charitable-industrial-complex.html?_r=0">“The Charitable-Industrial Complex”</a>. Peter Buffett writes about what he calls “philanthropic colonialism”, where people would spend a lot of their money making donations essentially to feel better about themselves, without much regard to whether or not their donations were making a difference or avoiding unintended consequences.

This message is a good one. It’s echoed here by Giving What We Can, and other organizations like <a href="http://goodintents.org/">“Good Intentions Are Not Enough”</a>, and is a core message of what we call the effective altruism movement.

However, this is not the message that Peter Buffett ends up running with.<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
It turns out Peter Buffett himself doesn’t like thinking in terms of “return on investment” – he says:

<blockquote>With more business-minded folks getting into the act, business principles are trumpeted as an important element to add to the philanthropic sector. I now hear people ask, "what’s the R.O.I.?" when it comes to alleviating human suffering, as if return on investment were the only measure of success.</blockquote>

Here, he mischaracterizes philanthropists, at least the ones that I know. “Return on investment” or, rather, looking at how much impact one has per dollar of their donation, is not a fancy business term about cash flows. Instead, it’s looking at actual outcomes precisely in amount of suffering alleviated, and figuring out how to alleviate the most suffering given our resources. The use of this kind of language was a response to Buffett’s concern that charities weren’t measuring their impact.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
But even this isn’t what Peter Buffett really is concerned about. His main worry is that the very act of donating itself is keeping people entrenched in a system of inequality that is perpetuated by those who can afford to donate. He says:

<blockquote>Inside any important philanthropy meeting, you witness heads of state meeting with investment managers and corporate leaders. All are searching for answers with their right hand to problems that others in the room have created with their left. […] But this just keeps the existing structure of inequality in place. The rich sleep better at night, while others get just enough to keep the pot from boiling over.</blockquote>

It’s hard to imagine this is the entire picture. Certainly there is harm done by economic inequality and some of it probably is perpetuated by large corporations. But there’s also disease, famine, and natural disasters – none of which even the most sinister corporation could be causing.

And the donations the rich – or even the significantly less wealthy – give to our recommended charities are working. Things are actually getting better, not worse.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Peter Buffett appears to be suggesting that it is bad to make things better, because that reduces the chance of a dramatic change in society. However, as Jeff Kaufman <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-06-08">wrote in response to Slavoj Zizek</a>, even if a better system is coming, does our charity really delay it? If people <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF">don't get malaria</a>, <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly">have more money</a>, or <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative">grow up with fewer parasites</a> are they any less empowered or motivated to change their situation for the better? If they are, is this effect very large? Is this effect large enough that your donation does more through indirect effects to delay the implementation of a better system than it does by direct effects to make people's lives better?

He also quotes some statistics about rising inequality, a <a href="http://makewealthhistory.org/2013/07/08/is-global-inequality-rising-or-falling/">somewhat misleading claim</a>, but beside the point. The statistics he doesn’t quote include the massive decline in extreme poverty, the decline in malaria rates, the eradication of polio, the decline in malnutrition, etc. Buffett calls this “kicking the can down the road”, but we call it success.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Peter Buffett wants “a new operating system” for the world, something that is “[n]ot a 2.0 or a 3.0, but something built from the ground up”. He says that the reason we can’t do this is because we’re short on imagination. However, what we’re really missing is the specifics. We’re short on actual alternatives for how the world could be and plans for coordinating everyone and getting them to agree to a new economic system.

Even if you think capitalism is the biggest thing keeping the extremely poor people down, Peter Buffett’s plan to change the world is still missing something big. His hand-waving is fine for those who are thinking big and imagining. And thinking big and imagination are important. But for those of trying to put his call for better aid into practice, we need specifics.

Political and economic change are important. But we do need to know where to move our donations to make this happen. We need good arguments and evidence for why the specific changes proposed will be effective.

Peter Buffett’s proposal is very short on that.

I'd rethink that, historically looking at the East India Company, de Biers, forget-their-name Fruit Company...even natural disasters you can think in terms of damaging a society's ability to respond, or perhaps damming causing unintended flooding etc.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions-july-edition/">"New Years Resolutions: July Edition</a>"</i>

I'm still going strong.

About half a year ago, I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions">outlined some New Years Resolutions</a>, and then did what I thought impossible -- used the power of blogging, precommitment, and betting to <i>actually stick to my plans</i>.  Following up <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/resolutions-update-july-edition/">my last report in July</a>, I present my August update, where I see how I'm doing against my goals, and... more importantly... <i>update</i> my goals based on how things are going so far.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Did July Go?</h2>
Overall, July was a great month for sticking to my habits, whether I have been trying to form them all year or just staring them for July.

<b>Points:</b> I'm using a point system to track habits, where each thing I want to do scores a certain amount of positive points for the day and each thing I want to not do scores a certain amount of negative points for the day, and I have a goal of reaching a certain point total at the end of the month.  This system offered the ability to fail in one area and make up for it by overworking another area, or fail on one day and make up for it by overworking another day, which has it’s share of pros and cons, but overall is working better for me.  In July, I needed to score 13840 points and I succeeded, scoring 15445.  I had a high of 660 and a low of 340 for daily points acquired.

<b>Exercise:</b> I spent an average of 30 minutes a day exercising, exercising on 21 out of the 31 days.  My running has hit a new high of 3.8mi and my strength has ostensibly improved through progress on Convict Conditioning.  I look forward to getting back to Denison's gym.

<b>Diet:</b> My diet goals for this month were intentionally more lax.  All I had to do was drink at least 5 cups of water and 5 cups a milk a day, and consume a daily protein bar.  This worked well until I moved to England and couldn't find any protein bars.  Overall, I stayed on the water habit about 80% of the time and the milk habit about 55% of the time.

<b>Weight:</b> At the end of July, I weighed 180lbs.  This is an insignificant 1lbs drop in weight from the beginning of June.  I suppose it's good I was able to maintain my weight despite having a less planned diet.

<b>Productivity:</b>  I've now been spending a little over ten hours a day working on things, whether it be a job, writing, researching, or other stuff like that.  Time spent with friends and family dropped from 7 hours a day to a little under 5 hours a day, which is still quite a lot.

<b>Hygiene:</b> Again, I’m sure you don’t want the actual details.  Things are even better than they were in June, though.

<b>Annual Goals:</b> I had three goals to be completed by the end of the year: (1) write 200 blog essays, (2) add four games to the arcade, and (3) get my driver’s license.  I’ve now written 117/200 essays (59% of the essays in 59% of the time), have resumed work on the games, and am significantly closer to getting my license (but still haven't gotten it yet).

<h2>What's New for August?</h2>
<b>Virtues!</b>  I'm told that, at the age of 20, Benjamin Franklin created a system to develop his character, where he tracked his behavior along <a href="http://thirteenvirtues.com/">thirteen virtues</a>.  I don't think virtues are the basis for morality, but I do believe that thinking in terms of virtues can be a good way to aim for better behavior.  Since I like the theming, I've decided to categorize the habits I'm aiming to cultivate by various virtues, though for their instrumental value, not because I believe in virtue.

This month, I aim for <b>19840 points</b> that will come from the following:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Industry</h4>
<i>"It’s amazing how much you can get done if you’re always doing." -- Thomas Jefferson</i>

The virtue of industry is not about staying busy for the sake of busy, but about making sure important things get accomplished.

To this end, I'll still be tracking time spent on task.  However, I now will in addition be tracking the number of times per day I make use of <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">the Pomodoro Technique</a>, which is a technique of using a timer to alternate between doing good, focused work for 25 minutes and taking a break for 5 minutes.  "Breaking" a Pomodoro, or taking a break when it isn't break time (interruptions from others don't count) will be counted as negative points.

Secondly, I'm placing negative points on the curse of oversleeping.  This past month there have been many times when I've woken up a bit tired and decided to go back to sleep.  But no matter how long I go back to sleep for, I'll still wake up a little bit tired (generally because snooze sleep isn't very good quality).  If, instead, I just got out of bed immediately, I'd wake up in just a few minutes after drinking some water.

Lastly, another thing I'm going to do is introduce a little bit of urgency in my to-do list.  If I feel like a task is of particular urgency and must be done today, I will tag it with "kill order", which is a note to myself not to let the task survive the night.  If the sun rises on a task that I'm supposed to have killed, I lose 30 points.

<b>Summary</b>
Pomodoros = 5 points per Pomodoro completed.
Time spent on task (meetings, work, commute, etc.) = 15 points per half hour.
Wasting time (has a "I know it when I see it" standard) = -10 points per half hour.
Breaking a Pomodoro = -5 points each.
Defying a kill order = -30 points each.
Oversleeping = -20 points.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Fraternity</h4>
<i>"The company of others is what makes life great."</i>

While it's important that I spend time doing work, it's also very important that I spend time with people I like.  The only new thing here is that I'll now be tracking time spent with my family, friends, and my girlfriend all individually, to make sure that none of them go neglected.

<b>Summary</b>
Spend time with friends / family / girlfriend = 10 points per half hour.
Spend no time with one of those three = -30 points per group neglected.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Fitness</h4>
<i>"You can't have a healthy life without a healthy lifestyle."</i>

I'm doing two new things here.  To make my diet a bit healthier, I want to aim to eat a half cup of broccoli every day.  I also want to start cutting out fried foods and white grains as a part of a transition to <a href="http://www.nomeatathlete.com/healthy-eating/">eating more whole foods</a>.

<b>Summary</b>
Exercise (biking, running, strength training) = 30 points for every 30 minutes.
Walking = 10 points for every 30 minutes.
Drink 5 cups of water = 20 points.
Drink 5 cups of milk = 20 points.
Eat a protein bar = 20 points.
Eat half a cup of broccoli = 20 points.
Eat a fried food = -20 points.
Eat a white grain = -20 points.
Eat a sweet = -20 points.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cleanliness</h4>
<i>"Cleanliness is next to godliness."</i>

Nothing remarkably new here.

<b>Summary</b>
Shower = 30 points.
Deoderant = 10 points.
Floss = 10 points.
Brush teeth = 10 points.
Mouthwash = 10 points.
Shave = 10 points.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Order</h4>
<i>"A cluttered room is a cluttered mind."</i>

In order to make sure things are in order, I need to make sure I keep up on my logs and inboxes every day, and make sure my bed and room are clean.  For <a href="everydayutilitarian.com/logs">logs</a>, I'll be aiming to keep track of my time, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-is-peter-exercising/">exercise</a>, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/biphasic-sleep-logs/">sleep</a>, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-reading/">reading</a>, and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-watching/">television</a>.  I no longer will be keeping my <a href="www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/gratitude-journal/">gratitude journal</a> though, since I found that I'm already happy enough, and updating it was just beginning to be annoying.

<b>Summary</b>
Update logs = 30 points.
Unprocessed inbox at end of day = -20 points.
Going to bed with a messy room -20 points.
Being out of the room for longer than 30 minutes with the bed unmade = -20 points.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Silence</h4>
<i>"There are certain things which are best not said.  What are those things?  I shouldn't say."</i>

Following Scott Alexander's essay on <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/14/the-virtue-of-silence/">"The Virtue of Silence"</a>, I am going to avoid not saying the things that should not be said.  -20 points for each time I do.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Humility</h4>
<i>"The first test of a truly great man is his humility. By humility I don't mean doubt of his powers or hesitation in speaking his opinion, but merely an understanding of the relationship of what he can say and what he can do." -- John Ruskin</i>

I think the Art of Manliness's <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2008/05/25/the-virtuous-life-humility/">guide to humility</a> is a good starting point here, making sure that we give credit where credit is due, don’t name/experience drop, and stop one-upping people.  (Though the guide says we should do charity anonymously, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/to-inspire-people-to-give-be-public-about-your-giving/">which I think is problematic</a>.)

Additionally, I want to practice more humility in making claims about things, trying my hardest not to overstate what the evidence allows me to state, avoiding both underconfidence and overconfidence.

-10 points for each time I break this.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Frugality</h4>
<i>"A penny saved is a penny earned." -- Benjamin Franklin</i>

My spending is still difficult to fully articulate because, as a college student, there are still things my parents pay for and things I pay for.  Of the things I pay for (like fraternity dues, food, gifts, entertainment, books, essentials, entertainment, and travel), I want to keep to $4500 for this year.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
Again, I'm not practicing virtues for the sake of virtues, but for their instrumental value in living a better life.  I'm still <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/who-is-this-peter-guy/">guided by utilitarianism</a> first and foremost, as much as possible, not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics">virtue ethics</a>.  The list of virtues you see here aren't even a list of all virtues I think are important, but rather just useful ways to categorize the habits that I am tracking.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/blog/philosophy/effective-altruism-charity-peter-singer/#.UZOnGiuY5Sa">"Becoming Superman"</a>: "Alexander had big plans for life after university. Upon completing his engineering degree, he was going to fly out to Africa and build dams. In the end, he took a mergers and acquisitions job in the City. Rather than a story of idealism lost, however, this is one of idealism redirected. Alexander now gives around 50 per cent of his salary to charity, one of the growing number of converts to moral philosophy’s latest revolution: effective altruism."

Window shopping might be a good thing after all, because <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/why-wanting-expensive-things-makes-us-so-much-happier-than-buying-them/276717/">wanting something expensive might make us happier than actually buying that expensive thing</a>.

I've been very surprised in my life to notice how even the most trivial inconveniences -- like having to walk up a flight of stairs -- can stop me from doing what I would otherwise want to do.  Scott Alexander <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/">notices the same</a> with mail-in rebates and proxies to get around the Great Firewall of China.  Not spending 10 minutes to mail in a $200 rebate is insane -- you're passing up what is pretty much a job that pays $1200 an hour!  But the real lesson here is not one of admiring irrationality, but one of being able to make systems better by removing these inconveniences.

There's a subtle difference between <a href="http://havingneweyes.com/2013/07/28/looking-like-you-are-helping-vs-actually-helping/">looking like you're helping and actually helping</a>, and it's actually pretty difficult to notice.  Somewhat related is the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/8gv/the_curse_of_identity/">curse of identity</a> where you substitute that which actually accomplishes a goal of yours with something that you can convince yourself looks close enough to accomplishing the goal.<!--more-->

For similar reasons as the ones that motivated me to write about <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">why I'm skeptical of speculative causes</a>, Jeff Kaufman asks <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2011-10-07">what metrics he can use to tell if such an organization is effective</a>.  This is an important point -- if we can't know if they're doing a good job, how do we know if they're doing a good job?

What do both Amazon and China have in common?  <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/02/amazon_coins_jeff_bezos_brilliant_plan_to_give_free_money_to_kindle_fire.html">Achieving success through currency manipulation</a>.

Some very useful guides to healthy eating I've been trying to work from: <a href="http://zenhabits.net/plant-fueled/">"The Healthful Vegan Diet"</a> and <a href="www.nomeatathlete.com/healthy-eating/">"The Only Healthy Eating Guide You'll Ever Need"</a>.  (No, I'm not going vegan, and yes, it is ironic that I'm using a second guide when the other guide claims to be the only one I'll ever need.)

<a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/05/15/polarization-is-real-and-asymmetric/">Interesting facts about US political poliarization</a>: It exists, both political parties are becoming more extreme, but Republicans are becoming far more extreme than Democrats.

				<title>What Would it Take to &quot;Prove&quot; a Speculative Cause?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">Why I'm Skeptical About Unproven Causes (And You Should Be Too)</a></i>

My previous essay <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">Why I'm Skeptical About Unproven Causes (And You Should Be Too)</a> generated a lot of discussion on <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/i6f/why_im_skeptical_about_unproven_causes_and_you/">LessWrong</a> and <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too">the Effective Altruist blog</a>.

Some related questions that came up a lot was: what does it take to prove a cause?  What separates "proven" from "speculative" causes?  And how do you get a "speculative" cause to move into the "proven" column?  I'm going to tackle that here.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Proven Cause vs. Speculative Cause</h2>
My prime example of proven causes are <a href="http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell's top charities</a>.  These organizations -- <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx">The Against Malaria Foundation</a> (AMF), <a href="http://www.givedirectly.org">GiveDirectly</a>, and <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a> (SCI) -- are rolling out programs that have been the target of significant scientific scrutiny.  For example, delivering long-lasting insecticide-treated anti-malaria nets (what AMF does) has been studied by <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets">23 different randomized, controlled trials</a> (RCTs).  GiveWell has also published thorough reviews of all three organizations (see reviews for <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf">AMF</a>, <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly">GiveDirectly</a>, and <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative">SCI</a>).

On the other hand, a speculative cause is a cause where the case is made entirely by intuition and speculation, with zero scientific study.  For some of these causes, scientific study may even be impossible.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now, I think 23 RCTs is a very high burden to meet.  Instead, we should recognize that being "proven" is not a binary yes or no, but rather a sliding scale.  Even AMF isn't proven -- there still are some areas of concern or potential weaknesses in the case for AMF. Likewise, other organizations working in the area, like <a href="http://www.nothingbutnets.net/">Nothing But Nets</a>, also are nearly as proven, but don't have key elements of transparency and track record to make myself confident enough.  And AMF is a lot more proven that GiveDirectly, which is potentially more proven than SCI given <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2012/07/13/new-cochrane-review-of-the-effectiveness-of-deworming/">recent developments in deworming research</a>.

Ideally, we'd take a <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/">Bayesian approach</a>, where we have a certain prior estimate about how cost-effective the organization is, and then update our cost-effectiveness estimate based on additional evidence as it comes in.  For reasons <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">I argued earlier</a> and GiveWell has argued in <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/">"Why We Can't Take Expected Value Estimates Literally (Even When They're Unbiased)"</a>, <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2011/11/10/maximizing-cost-effectiveness-via-critical-inquiry/">"Maximizing Cost-Effectiveness Estimates via Critical Inquiry"</a>, <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2011/11/04/some-considerations-against-more-investment-in-cost-effectiveness-estimates/">"Some Considerations Against More Investment in Cost-Effectiveness Estimates"</a>, I think our prior estimate should be quite skeptical (i.e. expect cost-effectiveness to be not as good as AMF / much closer to average than naïvely estimated) until proven otherwise.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Right now, I consider AMF, GiveDirectly, and SCI to be the only sufficiently proven interventions, but I'm open to other organizations also entering this area.  Of course, this doesn't mean that all other organizations must be speculative -- instead there is a middle ground of organizations that are neither speculative or "sufficiently proven".

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>From Speculative to Proven</h2>
So how does a cause become proven?  Through more measurement.  I think this is best described through examples:

<a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org">Vegan Outreach</a> and <a href="http://www.thehumaneleague.com/">The Humane League</a> work to advertise people reducing the amount of meat in their diets in order to avoid <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-eat-less-meat/">cruelty in factory farms</a>.  They do this through leafleting and Facebook ads.  Naïve cost-effectiveness estimates would guess that, even under rather pessimistic assumptions, this kind of advocacy <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/">is very cost-effective</a>, perhaps around <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">$0.02 to $65.92 to reduce one year of suffering on a factory farm</a>.

But we can't be sure enough about this and I don't think this estimate is reliable.  But we can make it better with additional study.  I think that if we ran three or so more studies that were relatively independent (taking place in different areas and run by different researchers), addressed current problems with the studies (like lack of a control group), had longer time-frames and larger sample sizes, and still pointed toward a conversion rate of 1% or more, than I would start donating to this kind of outreach instead, believing it to be "sufficiently proven".

Another example could be <a href="http://www.80000hours.org">80,000 Hours</a>, an organization that runs careers advice and encourages people to shoot for higher impact careers using their free careers advising and resources.  One could select a group of people that seem like good candidates for careers advice, give them all an initial survey asking them specific things about their current thoughts on careers, and then randomly accept or deny them to get careers advice.  Then follow up with everyone a year or two later and see what initial careers they ended up in, how they got the jobs, and for the group that got advising, how valuable in retrospect the advising was.  With continued follow up, one could measure the difference in expected impact between the two groups and figure out how good 80K is at careers advice.

Perhaps even <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/">The Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> (MIRI) could benefit from more measurement.  The trouble is that it's working on a problem (making sure that advanced artificial intelligence goes well for humanity) that's so distant, it's difficult to get feedback.  But they still potentially could assess the success or failures of their attempt to influence the AI community and they still could try to solicit more external reviews of their work from independent AI experts.  I'm not close enough to MIRI to know whether these would be good or bad ideas, but it seems plausible at first glance that even MIRI could be better measured.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
And it wouldn't be too difficult to expand this to other areas.  For example, I think GiveWell's tracking of money moved is reliable enough and <a href="http://www.givewell.org/about/self-evaluation">their commitment to self-evaluation</a> (and external review) strong enough that I would strongly consider funding them before any of their top charities, if they ever had any room for more funding (which they currently do not and <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2012/11/03/giving-to-givewells-recommended-charities-helps-givewell/">urge you to donate to their top charities instead</a>).  <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org">Effective Animal Activism</a> could do the same and I think have even higher success, because I think it's moderately likely that if someone starts donating to animal charities after joining EAA, there are few other things that could have influenced them.

Of course, these forms of measurement have their problems, and no measurement -- even two dozen RCTs -- will be perfect.  But some level of feedback and measurement is incredibly necessary to avoid our own biases and failures in naïve estimation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Proven and The Promising: My Current Donation Strategy</h2>
My current donation strategy is to separate organizations into three categories: <b>proven</b>, <b>promising</b>, and <b>not promising</b>.

Proven organizations are the ones that I talked about earlier -- AMF, GiveDirectly, and SCI.

Promising organizations are organizations I think have a hope of becoming proven, someday.  They're organizations practicing interventions that intuitively seem like they would have high upside (like 80K Hours in getting people into better careers and The Humane League in persuading a bunch of people to become vegetarian), have a good commitment to transparency and self-measurement (The Humane League shines here), and have opportunities for additional money to be converted into additional information on their impact.

My goal in donating would be to first ensure the survival of all promising organizations (make sure they have enough funding to stay around) and then try to buy information from promising organizations as much as I can.  For example, I'd be interested in funding more <a href="http://humaneleaguelabs.wordpress.com">studies about vegetarian outreach</a> or making sure 80K has the money they need to <a href="http://www.80000hours.org/recruitment">hire a new careers advisor</a>.

Once these needs are met, I'll save a fair amount of my donation to meet future needs down the road.  But then, I'll spend some on proven organizations to (a) achieve impact, (b) continue the incentive for organizations to want to be proven, and (c) show public support for those organizations and donating in general.

...Now I just need to actually get some more money.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Here's his answer to my new questions:

"The researchers working on this particular study are interested in adding a few other conditions into the study, which are indeed interesting, but which would up the cost considerably - to about $15k (to do everything they want to do). However, they also told me that they have $4k already and they are right now applying for the remainder from their University, and they are somewhat optimistic about getting it, so it's possible that we'll be able to get all the funding we need from the study from the University. If we don't, we'll cut out some of those additional conditions, and be back to a situation of needing some extra funding to go forward with the study. They expect to know in 3-4 weeks.

As for the other grant I mentioned, because we are *hoping* that money for this Veg Ads study comes through from the University, the grant request we are putting in to the one donor who expressed interest will be focused on other research projects we want to do, virtually all of which are split-tests and similar studies designed to make vegan advocacy efforts more effective (as opposed to measure the diet change impact of current interventions). I've been in touch with the 5 other main veg advocacy orgs and gotten from them a list of research they would hope to have done, and compiled it into a list of 14 studies we hope to eventually do. I'd be happy to share the list with you if that would be of interest in the event this Veg Ads study gets fully funded by the University. That is definitely research that would not happen/will not happen until we get funding for it.

What might be of particular interest with those is that, in order to get them done, our current projected costs are pretty low for each study but that also means they are not as thorough as they could be. So not only is there need/opportunity for funding those, but additional money for them would definitely make them more thorough and they definitely will not be more thorough unless someone decides to donate money with the specific intent of making them so."]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks, Soren, that's a great opportunity.

Does THL actually need more money for these kind of studies?  Could they reliably turn additional earmarked donations into additional studies in both the case where they get the grant funding and in the case where they do not?

If so, I think more people should know about this.  I know a few other people who think like I do and think that funding veg studies is an incredibly promising opportunity for future donations and I could probably get them to donate to THL for this.  Getting $4K-$5K sounds pretty doable.

Personally, I recently just invested all my excess income so I don't have any money available to donate at the moment, but I expect to get additional income by the end of the month that I could donate to THL.  I'd probably have a little over $1K I could personally give at that point and perhaps could leverage that gift to get other people to also do it.

Thoughts?]]></wp:comment_content>

It would be good to know where the funding comes from if there is no grant. Probably from the general donations.

I'm wondering where I should donate myself. Maybe we could get THL to do more or better studies by enticing them with donations so to speak. So you think that some people would like to do this kind of earmarked donation? 

In that case it would be good to know when the decision on the grant is made in order to see if one should postpone the donation until then. I will write another mail and ask how much research will be done with earmarked donations that wouldn't have been done otherwise.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Peter, good post again! My comment is specifically about the THL studies on veg-outreach. Nick Cooney told me it's possible to donate to THL and mail him the amount of the donation and that it should be earmarked to veg-ad research. They are planning a big controlled study to get robust evidence about all aspects of veg-ads. They are also planning to get a grant for this. 

Here is what he wrote:
" we are working with some researchers at the University of Texas right now on designing a very thorough study on the impact of the facebook veg ads on diet change. We hope to launch it and start data collection next month, to have results by the end of the year, and the researchers are currently trying to get funding from the U of Texas for the costs involved with it (which are around $4-5,000). 

The current plan includes a control group, follow-up surveying without revealing that the survey has to do with the website; measuring intent to change, actual change, and steps taken toward changing; and having tens of thousands of participants initially (with the number that actually report their diet change being much smaller than that, but still sizeable). The researchers plan to submit it for publication afterwards, so it will be done in a rigorous manner

So if that were the sort of thing you (and others) would be interested in funding, that would definitely help enable us to proceed with it and get very good data!

If you're interested, all you'd have to do is donate to THL ( at http://www.TheHumaneLeague.com/donate ), and then email me to let me know how much you donated and that you want it to go specifically toward this research, and we'll use it accordingly. If the University of Texas ends up giving us grant money to do it, so that your donation wasn't needed for this study, we could put your donation toward the next similar study we do - we have a number being planned and in the pipeline."

I think this sort of evidence could also be helpful for Effective Fundraising to get them a grant. Maybe some people who donate to animal causes would like to make this earmarked donation. It certainly sends a good signal. 

Now I'm not saying donate to THL instead of EAA, 80k or anything, but if you do, you might want to do this.]]></wp:comment_content>

Previously, I wrote <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">"Why I'm Skeptical About Unproven Causes (And You Should Be Too)"</a> and a follow up essay <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-would-it-take-to-prove-a-speculative-cause/">"What Would It Take to Prove a Speculative Cause?"</a>.  Both of these sparked a lot of discussion <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/i6f/why_im_skeptical_about_unproven_causes_and_you/">on LessWrong</a>, <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too">on the Effective Altruist blog</a>, and my own blog, as well as many hours of in person conversation.

After all this extended conversation with people, I've changed my mind on a few things that I will elaborate here.  I hope in doing so I can (1) clarify my original position and (2) explain where I now stand in light of all the debate so people can engage with my <i>current ideas</i> as opposed to the ideas I no longer hold.  My opinions on things tend to change quickly, so I think updates like this will help.

<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My Argument, As It Currently Stands</h2>
If I were to communicate one main point of my essay, based on what I believe now, it would be <b>when you're in a position of high uncertainty, the best response is to use a strategy of exploration rather than a strategy of exploitation</b>.

What I mean by this is that given the high uncertainty of impact we see now, especially with regard to the far future, we're better off trying to find more information about impact and reduce our uncertainty (exploration) rather than pursuing whatever we think is best (exploitation).

The implications of this would mean that:

<ol>
<p><li>We should develop more of an attitude that our case for impact is neither clear nor proven.</li></p>
<p><li>We should apply more skepticism to our causes and more self-skepticism to our personal beliefs about impact.</li></p>
<p><li>We should use the language of "information" and "exploration" more often than the language of "impact" and "exploitation".</li></p>
<p><li>We should focus more on finding specific and concrete attempts to ensure we're making progress and figure out our impact (whether it be surveys, experiments, soliciting external review from relevant experts, etc.).</li></p>
<p><li>We should focus more on transparency about what we're doing and thinking and why, when relevant and not exceedingly costly.</li></p>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
And to be clear, here are specific statements that address misconceptions about what I have argued:

<ol>
<p><li>I do think it is wrong to ignore unproven causes completely and stop pursuing them.</li></p>
<p><li>I don't think we should be donating everything to the Against Malaria Foundation instead of speculative causes.</li></p>
<p><li>I don't think the Against Malaria Foundation has the highest impact of all current opportunities to donate.</li></p>
<p><li>I do think we can say useful things about the far future.</li></p>
<p><li>I don't think the correct way to think about high uncertainty and low evidence is to "suspend judgement".  Rather, I think we should make a judgement that we expect the estimate to be much lower than initially claimed in light of all the things I've said earlier about <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">the history of past cost-effectiveness estimates</a>.</li></p>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
And, lastly, if I were to make a second important point it would be <b>it's difficult to find good opportunities to buy information</b>.  It's easy to think that any donation to an organization will generate good information or that we'll automatically make progress just by working.  I think some element of random pursuit is important (see below), but all things considered I think we're doing too much random pursuit right now.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Specific Things I Changed My Mind About</h2>

Here are the specific places I changed my mind on.

<b>I used to think donating to AMF, at least in part, was important for me.  Now I don't.</b>

I underestimated the power of exploring and the existing opportunities, so I think that 100% of my donations should be going to trying to assess impact.  I've been persuaded that there is already quite a lot of money going toward AMF and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/practical-limits-to-giving-now-and-the-haste-consideration/">we might not need more money as quickly as thought</a>, so for the time being it's probably more appropriate to save and then donate to opportunities to buy information as they come up.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>I now agree that there are relevant economies of scale in pursuing information that I hadn't taken into account.</b>

What I mean by this is it might not be appropriate for individuals to work on purchasing information themselves.  Instead, this could end up splitting up the time of organizations unnecessarily as they provide information to a bunch of different people.  Also, many people don't have the time to do this themselves.

I think this has two implications:
<ol>
<li>We should put more trust in larger scale organizations who are doing exploring, like <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, and pool our resources.</li>
<li>Individuals should work harder to put relevant information about information we gather online.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>I was partially mistaken in thinking about how to "prove" speculative causes.</b>

I think there was some value in my essay <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-would-it-take-to-prove-a-speculative-cause/">"What Would It Take to Prove a Speculative Cause?"</a> because it talked concretely about strategies some organizations could take to get more information about their impact.

But the overall concept is mistaken -- there is no arbitrary threshold of evidence at which a speculative cause needs to cross and I was wasting my time by trying to come up with one.  Instead, I think it's appropriate to continue doing expected value calculations as long as we maintain a self-skeptical, pro-measurement mindset.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>I had previously not fully taken into account the cost of acquiring further information.</b>

The important question in value of information is not "what does this information get me in terms of changing my beliefs and actions?" but actually "how valuable is this information?", as in, do the benefits of gathering this information outweigh all the costs?  In some cases, I think the benefits of further proving a cause probably don't outweigh the costs.

For one possibly extreme example, while I don't know the rationale for doing a 23rd randomized controlled trial on anti-malaria bednets after performing the previous 22, it's likely that doing that RCT would have to be testing something more specific than the general effectiveness of bednets to justify the high cost of doing an RCT.

Likewise, there are costs on organizations to devoting resources to measuring themselves and being more transparent.  I don't think these costs are particularly high or defeat the idea of devoting more resources to this area, but I hadn't really taken them into account before. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>I'm slightly more in favor of acting randomly (trial and error).</b>

I still think it's difficult to acquire good value of information and it's very easy to get caught "spinning our wheels" in research, especially when that research has no clear feedback loops.  One example, perhaps somewhat controversial, would be to point to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_progress">the multi-century lack of progress on some problems in philosophy</a> (think meta-ethics) as an example of what can happen to a field when there aren't good feedback loops to ground yourself.

However, I underestimated the amount of information that comes forward just doing ones normal activities.  The implication here is that it's more worthwhile than I initially thought to fund speculative causes just to have them continue to scale and operate.

I'm concerned about this too.

I think this is less clear.  I know a moderate amount about what GiveWell is making and how they intend to achieve and demonstrate progress in their domain.  I think this is currently not true for FHI and CSER, but I could be convinced otherwise.

<blockquote>But what about scanning for asteroids? This has a pretty straightforward case for its benefits, but is not ‘proven’, and is never going to be supported by an RCT or cohort study.</blockquote>

I agree with <a href="(http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/ic0/where_ive_changed_my_mind_on_my_approach_to/9lj2" rel="nofollow">the thoughts expressed by Carl Shulman</a> and would have said the same thing.  However, I do think it's possible there is scalable existential risk interventions that are reasonably understood and progress can be confidently made on them.  I just don't yet know what they are.

For the record, my position is not "I need an RCT or I won't trust it".]]></wp:comment_content>

<blockquote>Now, these revisions seem like moving from a “quantified” giving approach to a more open-ended approach. But I think they don’t especially concern causes oriented toward the far future.  Is this right?</blockquote>

In so far as I'm not yet giving my money to FHI/CSER/MIRI, then yes, you're correct.  But I think it's a fallacy to assume that just because a cause is the most important, organizations working within that cause are the most worthy of donations.  Likewise, it's a fallacy to assume that just because I'm not donating to x-risk orgs, that I can't care about x-risk.  (Though, I'm not actually saying you think these things.)

~

<blockquote>Also, what would you give for an example of something useful we can say about the far future (that translates into a specific action)?</blockquote>

I think it's possible to give <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hmb/many_weak_arguments_vs_one_relatively_strong/" rel="nofollow">multiple weak arguments</a> that the far future might be good in expectation, which means it's good to focus on making it more likely to happen.

I think we can say that <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/" rel="nofollow">flow through effects</a> are really important, so, perhaps it's less optimal to focus on areas with less flow through opportunities (like animals).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I was just talking with some EA types about this post and there was agreement all around that it shows great intellectual virtue.

"I’ve been persuaded that there is already quite a lot of money going toward AMF"

In 2012 Givewell <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/12/givewell-annual-review-for-2012-details-on-givewells-money-moved-and-web-traffic/" rel="nofollow">tracked</a> $9.57 million in money moved based on their recommendations. And so far this year donations have more than <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/07/update-on-givewells-web-traffic-money-moved-q2-2013/" rel="nofollow">doubled</a>.

So AMF's room for more funding will be going quickly but probably not wholly exhausted this year (they say they have $40-50MM worth of RFMF). However, GiveDirectly seems to be able to soak up arbitrary amounts of cash, as it consists in giving cash to people.

A related point worth mentioning concerns the externalities of donations to GiveWell charities (strengthening the idea of EA, bolstering GiveWell's reputation, etc). GiveWell's money moved has grown explosively, which is fantastic, but every time their money moved doubles the proportional impact of an extra dollar on their money moved is halved. An early $100,000 donation via GiveWell may have had a noticeable impact on their access to charities, reputation, and so forth, but that would not be the case today generally.

On the other hand, GiveWell has proven it can sustain fast exponential growth (on the order of annual doubling) for an impressively long time, which is an important partial offset.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[An impressive post. On a personal note, sometimes I think that I will one day lose the ability to change my mind. I will become dull, stubborn and conservative, and keep publishing rephrasings of my same old views, as do many philosophers and academics. From then on, I will just keep rationalising my existing views, on and on, until I die. Whatever degree of neuroplasticity ageing people have, this probably motivates me to update aggressively, and now! So congratulations on being mentally *alive*!

Now, specific feedback: As per your initial post, you highly value the high future. As per this post, you favour exploration over exploitation. 
Now that you have inreased your valuation of Givewell, you should do the same for the Future of Humanity Institute and Center for Study of Existential Risk, right? If you still do not value FHI and CSER, perhaps you still want to improve the future with interventions like AMF's that have 'proven' near-future benefits. But what about scanning for asteroids? This has a pretty straightforward case for its benefits, but is not 'proven', and is never going to be supported by an RCT or cohort study. I'm not sure you've really thought through the consequences of dissolving this concept of 'proven' vs 'unproven'. Your thoughts?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The way I read your previous post on being skeptical of unproven causes was that it was mostly about the far future. 

Now, these revisions seem like moving from a "quantified" giving approach to a more open-ended approach. But I think they don't especially concern causes oriented toward the far future.

Is this right? 

Also, what would you give for an example of something useful we can say about the far future (that translates into a specific action)?

I do think people focused on far-future causes tend to overestimate their effectiveness (though whether moreso than other causes I'm not sure) and that you astutely pointed this out in your previous post.]]></wp:comment_content>

				<title>The Challenges of &quot;Great People&quot; as a Model for Social Change</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/the-challenges-of-great-people-as-a-model-for-social-change/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last summer, I finished reading David Bornstein's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Change-World-Social-Entrepreneurs/dp/0195138058">"How to Change the World: Social Entreprenuers and the Power of New Ideas"</a>. The book is pretty neat, detailing the work of several "social entrepreneurs", or talented people who work to solve social problems in their communities.

The book also details the non-profit organization <a href="http://www.ashoka.org/">Ashoka: Innovators for the Public</a> and its founder Bill Drayton, who helped fund and advise these social entrepreneurs. The stories are compelling, fascinating, and inspiring tales of people overcoming obstacles to make large scale changes for the better.

What bothers me about the book, though, is while it's called "How to Change the World", it's not actually a how-to book at all... at least not in any way that is immediately actionable or doesn't involve doing a lot of reading between the lines. The key premise is that there are great people out there who have great ideas and can do great things if only we trust them and fund them.

But if you aren't one of these great people -- or worse yet, you have no idea how to find these great people and trust them and fund them -- then you're out of luck. While there's a bit of confusion and mixed messaging throughout, the book seems to settle on the fact that not everyone can be a social entrepreneur. What are us everypeople supposed to do?<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Challenge of Selecting "Great People"</h2>
Ashoka is focused on finding "the Andrew Carnegie, Steve Jobs, and Henry Ford of the social change world" and giving them the funding and support they need to have a good idea. This kind of idea seems attractive to me -- working in grant selection for Denison VPC, I know how important it has been to find people we can trust and who we can build relationships with. The idea of also finding people in the prime and pushing them over the edge to success reminds me a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor">angel investing</a>. There's a certain notion of romanticism in thinking about being the one little push that was needed to get Andrew Carnegie started.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Selection Criteria</h4>
But I'm really not sure how to connect this enchanting idea to the reality I'm in, and "move from here to there" so to speak. How do we find these great people, or tell great people apart from not-so-great people? As detailed in the book and <a href="https://www.ashoka.org/support/criteria">on Ashoka's website</a>, there are selection criteria for identifying great people (and determining who gets the funding and support of Ashoka):

First, you need to be "possessed by a new idea — a new solution or approach to a social problem—that will change the pattern in a field". Your idea also must be likely to "change the field significantly and that will trigger nationwide impact or, for smaller countries, broader regional change". For example, Ashoka won't fund building a school unless its part of a broader program to reform education.

...You also need to be "creative both as goal-setting visionaries and as problem solvers capable of engineering their visions into reality".

...And the most important criterion, apparently, is entrepreneurial quality, which "defines leaders who see opportunities for change and innovation and devote themselves entirely to making that change happen".

...Lastly, you have to be trusted absolutely and without doubt.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>My Troubles</h4>
Ashoka has a good reputation as an organization, so I'm inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt. But I have to be honest in saying that this selection criteria doesn't really help me.

There are a fair amount of trustworthy, creative, hard-working people out there, but I honestly don't know if their ideas will work. How does Ashoka know if an idea will change the field significantly and trigger nationwide impact? Is it just a function of trusting the person, or is their idea evaluated on further criteria?

The book has detailed stories for nine people that Ashoka has supported, and they seem to have done good work for as far as I can tell. What's missing for me, however, is the <a href="https://www.ashoka.org/fellows">tale of the other 2109 fellows</a>. Not that I expect 2109 stories in the book, of course.

What I do worry, however, is that the stories are cherry-picked. This is not to imply intentional (or even unintentional) deception on the part of Ashoka, but rather a question: <strong>once you pass Ashoka's gauntlet, how likely are you to actually go on to high-impact activities?</strong> For me and as far as I can tell, this critical question remains unanswered. I'd be interested to see what stories of a <em>randomly selected</em> group of nine fellows would look like.

Another concern is best told by example: Sarah Palin frequently endorses candidates for Senator or Representative in various districts, who then go on to win the election. Palin then proudly announces that very few candidates manage to win without her endorsement.

But does this mean Palin's endorsement causes success? Given that Palin always endorses the candidate who is leading in the race, this seems unlikely. Rather it's the other way around -- success (and shared values) cause a Sarah Palin endorsement. Thus another (as far as I can tell) unanswered question I have for Ashoka: <strong>how many successful Ashoka fellows wouldn't have been nearly as successful if they hadn't been picked by Ashoka?</strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Challenge of Having a Great Idea</h2>
Again, Ashoka seems to be doing good, useful work. But given what I know about ideas -- many "great ideas" have been tried that turned out not to work after all. In <a href="http://denisonvpc.wordpress.com/2012/07/23/the-donor-isnt-always-right/">"The Donor Isn't Always Right"</a> I gave the example of the well-acclaimed PlayPumps. My co-blogger Kate Kloster <a href="http://denisonvpc.wordpress.com/2012/06/21/the-gray-of-social-change/">points to TOMS shoes and similar initatives</a>. GiveWell has <a href="http://givewell.org/giving101/Social-Programs-That-Just-Dont-Work">documentation of many failures</a> in education, job training, substance abuse programs (DARE), afterschool programs, etc.

<strong>The bottom line is that helping people is hard... especially when you're looking for dramatic nation-changing large-scale high-impact work.</strong> It's extraordinarily difficult to have a great idea that turns out to actually work. And it's extraordinarily easy to look at an idea that <em>looks</em> great and <em>seems</em> to actually work, until it turns out that it doesn't really.

I'd be willing to bet the folks at Ashoka are brilliant people, their fellows are brilliant people, and that they know what they're doing. But I also know that having a nation-changing idea is hard, exceptionally harder than most people think, and very easy to underestimate. If I'm going to buy into Ashoka's work and trust their trust of their fellows, I'd like a demonstration that their selection process does well.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people know of the <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a> where individuals don't each have a rational interest in keeping up a public space, and so all suffer.  The problem is insufficient ownership and can be solved by giving each person responsibility for maintaining a specific part.  But have you heard of the opposite problem -- <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2v/the_tragedy_of_the_anticommons/">the tragedy of the anticommons?</a>  These are problems of <i>too much</i> ownership rather than too little.

<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/7am/rational_home_buying/">Rational home buying</a>.  Lots of things go wrong, rationally speaking, when buying a house, so focus up.  Location matters lots, so does thinking clearly about money and savings, thinking realistically and practically about what you'd actually use the house for, happiness from relative not absolute wealth, and not overthinking things.

<a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/60-the-myers-briggs-type-indicator-a-popular-but-flawed-way-of-understanding-your-personality">Myers-Briggs is a bad indicator of personality.</a>  Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">The Big Five</a> instead.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/16/magazine/unspeakable-conversations.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm">Here's a report of the interaction between Peter Singer and Harriet Johnson</a>, a prominent member of the disability rights movement. This is great reading for a more nuanced understanding about how utilitarianism is viewed.

<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/22-maps-that-show-the-deepest-linguistic-conflicts-in-america-2013-6">"22 Maps That Show How Americans Speak English Totally Differently From Each Other"</a>.  <i>Totally different</i> is a stretch, but the maps are still interesting.

So, yeah, the people who have policy opinions that disagree with you <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/30/fetal-attraction-abortion-and-the-principle-of-charity/">probably aren't moral monsters</a>.

<a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/230-maximizing-your-donations-via-a-job">"Maximizing Your Donations via a Job"</a>.  Basically a how-to guide to getting a higher salary job in computer programming careers.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7EUIGpKhmY">"The Roots of Morality: Does Religion Play a Role or is the Tail Wagging the Dog?" The title of this YouTube video is technically a false dichotomy, but the video is still interesting.  Presents a lot of modern moral psychology in a compelling way.

				<title>Just How Effective Does Vegetarian Advocacy Need to Be?</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-would-it-take-to-justify-vegetarian-advocacy/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2013 04:00:05 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">How Much Does it Cost to Buy a Vegetarian?</a></b>

Naïve cost-effectiveness estimates suggest that if we assume (a) a pamphlet costs 20 cents, (b) 2% of people who receive a pamphlet go vegetarian for (c) an average of four years each, and (d) the average meat eater would eat 40 animals a year, then <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/">it costs a mere seven cents</a> to avert a year of nonhuman animal suffering on a factory farm.  That's a pretty good deal.

The problem is, however, that more work needs to be done on making these assumptions accurate -- particularly (b) and (c).  While <a href="http://humaneleaguelabs.wordpress.com/upcoming-research/">more studies are on their way</a>, it's interesting to think just how low (b) and (c) can be while still being better than our current best option.<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I take the current best option to be <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com">The Against Malaria Foundation</a>.  Perhaps there are other contenders for the best option, whether they be <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">speculative causes</a> or <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-would-it-take-to-prove-a-speculative-cause/">causes soon getting robust measurement</a>, but none of them have been presented with a clear enough estimate yet to make this calculation work.  Whether or not you think this is a flaw in the speculative causes or a flaw in my reasoning about causes is <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">a discussion for elsewhere</a>.

<a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved">According to GiveWell</a>, AMF saves a life for $2500, though this number has recently been <a href="https://twitter.com/GiveWell/status/341706469256871937">revised down to $2000</a> because of the <a href="http://news.againstmalaria.com/post/2013/06/03/LLINs-are-now-close-to-US3-per-net.aspx">newly reduced cost of bed nets</a>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
But, of course, "save a life" doesn't make sense because everyone dies eventually.  As the joke goes, <a href="http://www.sens.org/">life extension research</a> is the only charity actually working on <i>saving</i> lives.  But <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2007/12/04/what-a-life-saved-means/">GiveWell clarifies</a>:

<blockquote><span>If you save someone right as they exit infancy (5 years old), you’ve saved someone who probably has around a 50% chance of making it to age 60 … another way of putting this is that if you save two lives (very very rough estimate of cost: $2000), you’ve in expectation given one person a full life that they wouldn’t have had. (You’re actually getting more than this, of course, since a person has a 75% chance of making it to age 30, but let’s keep it simple.)</span></blockquote>

So, on this model, $2000 "buys" an additional thirty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year">years of healthy life</a> that would not have otherwise existed.  Simplifying, that's $66 to save a year of healthy life.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now let's go back to the assumptions.

For the same $66 you spend to save a year of healthy life via bednets, you could avert 942 years of nonhuman animal suffering on a factory farm given the assumptions we listed above.

This seems to give us a lot of room for pessimism.  What if we assumed the response rate were not 2%, but instead one tenth that -- 0.2%?  We'd still be averting a year of factory farming for 69 cents.  What conversion rate would it take to get to AMF's $66 mark?  <b>0.002%</b>, or <b>one person who becomes a vegetarian for every fifty thousand people who receive a pamphlet.</b>

Of course, even if you're on board with nonhuman animal suffering as something that matters, you might not think it's appropriate to weigh a year of chicken suffering averted as equal to a year of healthy human life gained.  It's a tricky philosophical question after all.  But even if you thought it took 100 chickens to outweigh a human, veg ads would still be worth it even if they only convinced <b>one in every five hundred people</b>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Indeed, we can be pessimistic on all counts.

...We could think it takes 10 chickens to outweigh a human.
...We could think the current studies are bad enough that they're off by a factor of 10.
...And we could think that people who convert only convert for one year on average rather than four years.

...And veg ads would still have <b>three fold</b> the cost-effectiveness of AMF.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now don't get me wrong, I actually think it's possible that the current studies are off by a factor of 10 or more.  This is why I think it's better to study veg ads than to fund them directly.

But I don't want this to be a cause for large despair, because <b>veg advocacy doesn't have to be all that good to be worth it.</b>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The flow-through effects per life-year for the mix of animals in your calculation have to be much smaller in magnitude than the flow-through effects of a life-year for a poor human: that calculation is almost all tiny fish.

The typical American spends a few hundred dollars a year on meat, only a portion of which goes to farms. A tiny fish is a vanishing portion of that expenditure, so the resources it uses up are correspondingly tiny, even accounting for externalities of climate change and impacts of food prices on the global poor. It essentially doesn't contribute positively to the global economy except by being eaten. So tiny direct flow-through effects, orders of magnitude less than a human.

If one talks about advocacy effects on human values, then it's largely not animal life-years that matter. On your calculation that pays no attention to differences between species tiny fish make up 98% of the badness of meat eating in life-years.

But consider A and B, where A eats a typical mix of animals, and B eschews fish in favor of more factory-farmed chicken. On your life-years metric the value of B turning vegan is only 2% of the value of A turning vegan, but in terms of effects on values the two should be almost identical, at the least within a factor of two.

So people whose justification for vegan ads stems from flow-through effects (many of the advocates think veganism increases total animal suffering in the medium run via impacts on wild animals, but favor ads with this argument) then it would be vegan-years that one focuses on, not unweighted animal life-years (a metric which says domestic animals are absolutely trivial relative to wild animals anyway).

And if you are buying vegan-years for $100 each, then if it were perfectly scalable it would cost ~$100 billion per year to turn the developed world vegan (early, before in vitro meat, Malthusian pressures, uploads/AI, or other factors eliminate meat consumption anyway). Veganism is only one modest factor affecting values, and several drag factors further reduce its influence. A hundred billion dollar annual budget could do much more in more targeted and leveraged interventions to shape the future, or promote veganism (in vitro meat research and development).]]></wp:comment_content>

I think I didn't focus enough attention on neuron discounting, though, so you're right to call me out on that.  I suppose neuron discounting might actually make vegetarian advocacy relative cost-ineffective.

<b>@Nick:</b> The potential lack of flow through effects in saving animals could be problematic.  I don't know if vegetarian advocacy has flow through effects or not.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[These estimates seem to bury key drivers, e.g. talking about chickens and factory farms while using figures that only make sense in terms of your fish numbers.

"But even if you thought it took 100 chickens to outweigh a human, veg ads would still be worth it even if they only convinced one in every five hundred people."

When I run your calculator with the "naive" assumptions from the beginning, with your numbers for chicken (only) numbers (28 broiler, 2 egg) and lifespans (42 and 365 days), it outputs a cost per year of life averted of $478.75. What calculation are you referring to in the quote?

"Naïve cost-effectiveness estimates suggest that if we assume (a) a pamphlet costs 20 cents, (b) 2% of people who receive a pamphlet go vegetarian for (c) an average of four years each, and (d) the average meat eater would eat 40 animals a year, then it costs a mere seven cents to avert a year of nonhuman animal suffering on a factory farm. That’s a pretty good deal."

You omitted "days of life per animal." But to replicate your estimate I had to use your 329.6 figure for average days per animal from this <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/" rel="nofollow">essay</a>, a result that depends almost entirely on estimates of tiny fish (98% of the life-years in your table) with brains on the order of 1/10,000th the size of a human brain.

If the fish-focused estimate made sense, then just eliminating fish consumption in favor of chicken would deliver almost all of the benefits of veganism in directly reduced farmed/feed animal suffering. The focus on fish also demands attention to the accuracy of the fish lifespan numbers, and the extent to which they reflect wild-caught feed fish vs farmed fish.

Moreover, if one thought there was so little difference in expected value between nervous systems of such different scales, that would make effects on the minute nervous systems of small invertebrates <a href="http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.ca/2013/07/vegan-advocacy-and-pessimism-about-wild.html" rel="nofollow">dominate</a> effects on farmed animals. The animal advocates who think the wild is negative expect that the short-run to medium-term effects of vegan ads would be to efficaciously increase animal suffering.

I don't see a coherent case for the cost-effectiveness estimates in the OP that really addresses the implications of the necessary premises.

And there are substantial reasons to doubt the view that the "life-years are identical across the nervous systems in question, despite enormous differences in scale." A "Pascal's Wager" approach faces the corresponding argument that "life-years of experience are equal across the right neural structures, whether clumped and communicating in one cranium or distributed among several." See pages 4-5 of this <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;t=139&amp;start=60" rel="nofollow">thread</a>.

This is without attending to various other factors such as flow-through effects (an individual tiny fish has very small impact on the course of society, again several orders of magnitude lower than humans) that sharply distinguish between creating human life-years and preventing life-years of small fish.]]></wp:comment_content>

"Naïve cost-effectiveness estimates suggest that if we assume (a) a pamphlet costs 20 cents, (b) 2% of people who receive a pamphlet go vegetarian for (c) an average of four years each, and (d) the average meat eater would eat 40 animals a year, then it costs a mere seven cents to avert a year of nonhuman animal suffering on a factory farm. That’s a pretty good deal...But even if you thought it took 100 chickens to outweigh a human, veg ads would still be worth it even if they only convinced one in every five hundred people."

So I input :

a) 5 pamphlets per dollar; 
b)0.002 for Conversions per Pamphlet/"one in every five hundred people" 
c) I use the "naive" 4 veg-years per conversion
d+e) In your table there are 28 broilers plus 2 egg laying chickens, with lifespans of 42 days and 365 days respectively, for a total of 1906 life days; one can input this as 30 animals with an average lifespan of 63.5333... I input it as 1 animals with 1906 days of life

That gives an estimate of $4.79 per year. Now we apply the adjustment you mentioned "even if you thought it took 100 chickens to outweigh a human". I did so by changing the life-days (animals*days lived) from 1906 to 19.06.

The calculator then reads out: 5; 0.002; 4; 1; 19.06; 0.76; $478.75]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Reading these comments, I see no inquiry into the possibility of exponential increase in the positive effects of pamphlet distribution.

First off, after a person receives a pamphlet, the chances of that person making a donation to an animal cruelty relief organization will presumably rise. This means that your contribution will effectively be multiplied by some factor. Obviously, you cannot decide where this money goes, but a portion of it will go back into pamphlet distribution and continue the cycle. If the ratio of donation to re-donation for pamphlet distrobution is equal to or greater than one, then a donation could have a theoretically infinite effect, including possible donations for in vitro meat.

Furthermore, as demand for vegetarian and vegan products rise, it will become easier to become a vegetarian or vegan. New products might appear, and restaurants might offer more vegetarian and vegan options.

Finally, as the percentage of vegetarians and vegans rise, there will be more peer pressure to reduce consumption of animal products and to remain vegetarian or vegan for a longer period of time. There would also be a reduction in peer pressure to consume animal products. Peer pressure might also produce donations to animal cruelty relief organizations.

I would conclude that a donation of this sort would in addition to the primary effect (which are what is being calculated in this essay), there will also be positive secondary effects.
I would also conclude that there is likely a tipping point, where when enough people are vegetarian or vegan, more people will become vegetarian or vegan until everyone is but the stubborn few, or animal conditions change.

Based on these, I would say that pamphlet distribution is a reasonable use of donations.]]></wp:comment_content>

Quite a few people have talked about whether or not it's better to donate money or donate time now rather than save and donate more money later.  While there's lots of nuance on these positions, there does seem to be roughly these two camps -- weighing in (mostly) on the give now side includes <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/20/give-now-or-give-later/">GiveWell</a>,  <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/our-research/donating-vs-investing">Giving What We Can</a>, <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/05/investment-and-inefficient-charity/">Scott Alexander</a>, <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration">Matt Wage</a>, and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/giving-now-currently-seems-to-beat-giving-later/">me</a>.  Weighing in (mostly) on the  give later side include <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/best-reason-give-later">Paul Christiano</a>, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/04/more-now-means-less-later.html">Robin Hanson</a>, and maybe <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?t=824">Brian Tomasik</a>.

The general idea in favor of giving/working now is what Matt Wage calls <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration">the haste consideration</a>, or the idea that we can spend resources now to get additional people involved in the movement, and doing so <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/giving-now-currently-seems-to-beat-giving-later/">multiplies our impact substantially</a> -- getting just one person to pursue altruism with the same effectiveness we would have done doubles our impact for the rest of our life.

This haste consideration, if true, has strong implications.  It means not only would we want to donate as soon as possible, but we'd want to make sure we earn money as soon as possible as well, meaning opportunities like law or medicine that have high incomes but also significantly more schooling may be less appealing from an altruistic perspective.  It also would mean we should be donating higher percentages of our income instead of saving, even if this would lead to giving less money over the long term.

However, I think the haste consideration might not be as powerful as it might appear, for three reasons I haven't seen discussed much:

<ol>
<li>Money and talent seems to encounter some bottlenecks in their usage and it seems difficult to make good use them at the rate they could be given.</li>
<li>There could be significantly better opportunities in the future that need funding and talent, and we need resources around to take up these opportunities as well.</li>
<li>If we take the haste consideration to it's logical conclusion, we face a potential <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> that we should be taking out large loans to finance the effective altruist movement.</li>
</ol>
<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
Before I begin to elaborate on these three points, I'd like to remind everyone that I'm speculating about funding needs that I know only a little bit about and it's quite possible I'm misrepresenting organization's needs for money or how they plan on using their funds.

I offer these ideas in the spirit of "putting things out there" for discussion and reconsideration, but I think there's a good chance that I'm wrong and look forward to being corrected.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How quickly can money and talent be used?</h2>
Right now it seems that the effective altruist movement cannot make quick use of large amounts of funding and talent.  There are a couple examples of this:

<b>Funding the Against Malaria Foundation</b>

First, the <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a> is said to be constrained entirely by a need for more money, but they're still holding on to <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/FinancialInformation.aspx">more than $4M</a> from the previous year that they weren't able to immediately convert into nets.  This leads me to believe, perhaps naïvely, that donating to AMF now versus donating to it a year ago would not make a difference in net distribution, therefore giving a larger length to the haste consideration than immediately thought.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Funding Effective Altruist Orgs</b>

Second, organizations where the haste consideration is most immediately applicable, like <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>, <a href="http://www.80000hours.org">80,000 Hours</a>, or <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org">Effective Animal Activism</a> are constrained not just by money but also by the talent needed to spend that money well.  Currently they're in large need of funding about six or seven staff positions between them.  While there's definitely a need for this staff, funding them would take up, by my guess, less than $200K in the first year.  Additional funding beyond that probably couldn't be spent immediately.

And even then, the salaries for careers couldn't be spent immediately either, because a recruitment process needs to be run first and people need to be hired and settled into their positions.  So even among the $200K that could be spent soon wouldn't be spent for several months, and therefore there would be little difference between donating now and donating a few months from now.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Working for Effective Altruist Orgs</b>

Furthermore, while the haste consideration would favor trying to launch into work as fast as possible without spending time to gather experience or further education in unrelated fields.  However, many of these organizations also lack the capacity to take on a large amount of staff for long periods of time and are only looking for the "best of the best".  Therefore, if you don't fall into the upper limit of talent, it would be more advisable to ignore the haste consideration here and work on cultivating further talent first.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>More Generally...</b>

Most generally, it seems like effective altruist organizations, like all organizations, are constrained by logistics and management and cannot absorb money and talent as quickly as it can be flung at them.  Perhaps this is optimistic of how many resources are being channelled into the effective altruist movement and it turns out that everything could be used up, but excess money and talent would be better invested until it can be used well.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Could there be significantly better opportunities just a few years from now?</h2>
On the flip side of things, it could turn out that we end up with enormously better opportunities to spend money in just a few years.  Given that <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/the-unintuitive-power-laws-of-giving">non-profit cost-effectiveness varies widely</a>, the discovery of a new giving opportunity (by say <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/category/givewell-labs/">GiveWell Labs</a>) could be huge and it's quite plausible that the returns from saving now and donating to this much better opportunity are higher than donating to whatever we can best find now.

It might make sense to give now if your giving time or money will make us find this opportunity quicker (<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">value of information in giving</a>), but it seems like many people are not in the position for this to be the case.  For example, GiveWell labs is already fully funded and working about as fast as they can, and there might not be anything we can do to speed things up but wait.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Should we take out loans to give now?</h2>
While perhaps unfair or infeasible for a variety of reasons, a possible <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the idea of giving as fast as possible is the idea that we would be in the best position to give now if we took out large loans and donated the proceeds.  Interest rates for loans are very frequently much less than the returns on giving now that some people have suggested, which could be 20% or more.  Therefore, one could take out a loan now, donate it all, and use the rest of the income they earn over their life to repay the loan.

I have an intuitive aversion to this idea of taking out a loan and I suspect other people do as well.  Exploring why we're averse to this idea could explain why it might be a bad idea to donate as much as possible now (or lead us to all take out loans).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Overall, it seems like the haste consideration is not as "smooth" or "linear" as it may seem.  Non-profits rarely spend every dollar right as it comes in, instead gathering together many donations and making large purchases all at once.  Therefore, whether you donate today or a year from now might not make much difference at all.

Given these constraints, I think it's worth taking the haste consideration somewhat seriously, but perhaps less seriously than it may seem on face value.  For example, I think it often would be a bad idea to do things like eschew further education or refuse to save portions of your income.  Though, luckily, I haven't heard of anyone taking the haste consideration so seriously that they would do this.

Another thing, AMF does claim they have room for funding (around 30-50mil more) and upon reading a little more about them (via Givewell and there website) I find this claim fairly believable - in short they plan on doing fewer and larger distributions.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have a few additions and critiques, for and against haste.

One anti-haste consideration is that, speed of growth is not the only factor for a movement: the quality or probability of that growth can be affected. For example, if one can reach maximum size in 19 years instead of 20 (with decades at maximum size thereafter), but at the cost of diluting the core ideas or damaging the reputation of the movement enough to reduce efficacy at maximum size by a few percent, that can easily be a bad deal. (HT: Toby Ord ). And a severe setback could lose the opportunity to pluck future low-hanging fruit (diminishing returns of movement size at any given time should make one more risk-averse with respect to movement growth).

For example, a movement that led people to take out massive personal debts or ruin their lives in hopes of slightly faster growth might damage its prospects in just that way.

On the other hand, I think the argument from lumpiness is seriously mistaken:

"This leads me to believe, perhaps naïvely, that donating to AMF now versus donating to it a year ago would not make a difference in net distribution...Overall, it seems like the haste consideration is not as “smooth” or “linear” as it may seem...So even among the $200K that could be spent soon wouldn’t be spent for several months, and therefore there would be little difference between donating now and donating a few months from now."

If AMF accumulates funding to conduct a large distribution (and they don't want to commit to one they can't fund), donating brings the distribution forward in time. And to the extent they face thresholds, that is a repeated thing: they have done a number of distributions already. If haste applies once every year or so (say December 2008, March 2010, June 2011...), that's functionally equivalent to continual haste. Donors routinely make their donations on an annual basis, for example.

In the same vein, delays in hiring of some months do not make a meaningful difference when hiring is substantially funding-limited: a charity can't initiate lots of delayed credible hiring processes if it can't fund them with existing or predictably accessible funds.

You can try to get more detailed information about what would be done with different levels of funding, as GiveWell does, and learn (probabilistically) that AMF has $X and will do another expected distribution at $X+N. But the response shouldn't just be "I won't donate anything unless my contribution is enough to push past $X+N": if all the donors did this without coordination the threshold would never be reached.

One could coordinate by forming a kickstarter or equivalent, but why bother? The money can accumulate in AMF's bank account instead of yours. There are possible reasons for such delay, e.g. maybe AMF is less able to make risky investments because of donor pressure, so you invest more aggressively in a DAF in preparation for a big fundraising drive. But on the whole, lumpiness of this kind just doesn't change the basic structure of the situation.

"Interest rates for loans are very frequently much less than the returns on giving now that some people have suggested, which could be 20% or more. "

These can only be temporary, a one-time multiplier, for reasons Paul Christiano explains <a href="http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/03/12/giving-now-vs-later/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

"Exploring why we’re averse to this idea could explain why it might be a bad idea to donate as much as possible now (or lead us to all take out loans)."

I think there are good reasons for this, e.g. at a 20% supposed rate of return that could be extrapolated indefinitely (somehow never saturating, which is very dubious given physics as we know them, among other reasons) it would be 38 times better to have a dollar 20 years ago than today. But looking at the best opportunities visible then and now we don't seem to see that level of difference. Indeed, as you mention opportunities may have improved or may improve in the future. 

However, I should also note that I would expect aversion to taking out loans even if it were altruistically optimal: it means reducing one's future importance and ending one's altruistic career early with a front-loaded cost and violating personal welfare heuristics and norms about debt (although of course the heuristics reflect empirical facts that also bear to a significant degree on altruistic concerns).]]></wp:comment_content>

				<title>Effective Altruist Job Board?</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/effective-altruist-job-board/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An idea I had while talking to Xio Kikauka and Joey Savoie is to run a jobs board for people interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">effective altruism</a>.  It seems like it actually would be relatively easy to have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL">a script</a> automatically monitor various job pages and synthesize them all into one area that looks nice.

Would this be useful to create? And if so, where should we get jobs from?

Some potential ideas:

<ul>
<li>The Humane League (<a href="http://www.thehumaneleague.com/jobs.htm">Jobs</a>, <a href="http://www.thehumaneleague.com/internships.htm">Internships</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/about/get-involved">Effective Animal Activism</a></li>
<li><a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/work-with-us">Giving What We Can</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.80000hours.org/recruitment">80,000 Hours</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.givewell.org/about/jobs">GiveWell</a></li>
<li>Innovations for Poverty Action (<a href="https://www.poverty-action.org/getinvolved/jobs">Jobs</a>, <a href="https://www.poverty-action.org/getinvolved/internships">Internships</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://careers.gatesfoundation.org/search/?q=&location">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a></li>
</ul>

<b>[Added 19 Aug:</b>
<ul>
<li>Oxfam (<a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/jobs/secretariat">International Secretariat</a>, <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/en/jobs/affiliates">Affiliates</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nyayahealth.org/join-us/">Nyaya Health</a></li>
<li>The Hunger Project (<a href="http://www.thp.org/get_involved/work_with_us/employment_opportunities">Jobs</a>, <a href="http://www.thp.org/get_involved/work_with_us/internship_opportunities">Internships</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://2xrecruit.kenexa.com/kr/cc/jsp/public/landingPage.jsf">Population Services International</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.goodventures.org/about-us/jobs">Good Ventures</a></li>
<li>Farm Sanctuary (<a href="http://www.farmsanctuary.org/get-involved/jobs-intern-volunteer/jobs/current-job-listings/">Jobs</a>, <a href="http://www.farmsanctuary.org/get-involved/jobs-intern-volunteer/internships/">Internships</a>)</li>
</ul>
<b>]</b>

I'd be willing to make this happen if people were interested.

<b>Update 30 Jan 2014:</b> I'm now maintaining the list of jobs over at the <a href="https://impact.hackpad.com/Job-Board-G2ZocnkVTsc">.impact Project page</a> instead.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://studentsforanimalrights.blogspot.com/2013/02/bowling-without-blindfolds-how-we-can.html">Focus on chickens to knock down the most animal suffering</a>: "Imagine you’re standing in a dining room before a massive table set with 100 plates. Spread among the plates is all the beef, chicken, and pork an average American consumes in one year. Since Americans eat so much meat, the plates are piled high with animal flesh.   If you tally up the plates, you'll find that 44 plates contain chicken, 30 contain beef, and 26 contain pork, since Americans eat slightly more chicken than beef or pork.  [But i]n place of the table, picture all the actual, live animals who were farmed and slaughtered to produce the meat you visualized on the plates. Looking upon this crowd of animals, you notice something strange: there’s a sea of chickens and . . . that’s it."

<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bruteforce">The costs of crime are higher than people think</a>: "Even if a burglar only causes $400 worth of damage, I’d pay far more than $400 to prevent a burglary — the loss of privacy, the sense of violation, the disruption of my normal order, the distraction of having to deal with police and repairmen and insurance agents, etc. [...And] we also have to count the harm to the criminals! Going through lengthy court proceedings, spending years in abusive prisons, having to deal with officious parole officers and the loss of liberty they cause are all serious costs and we can’t wave them away just because they happen to the bad guys."  Plus, the link includes discussion of game theory of crime prevention.<!--more-->

<a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/03/it-doesnt-have-to-be-hard.html">Giving doesn't have to be hard</a>.  Give some money.  (Maybe not that much.  $50 a year?)  Choose carefully where to give. (<a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell.org</a>?)  Earn more.  (If it wouldn't make you gag.)  And spend less.  Bottom line: "You can push your limits.  You can give until it hurts.  If you have the energy for that, great.  But you don't have to.  You can give where it's comfortable, and that will still be so much better than ducking away from the question of what you can do to help."

A really important concept for evaluating whether things are good or not is <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/28/thank-you-for-doing-something-ambiguously-between-smoking-and-not-smoking/">determining what they "funge" against</a>, or what would occur without them.  For example, drone warfare is bad to the degree that the alternative to drone warfare is peace and good to the degree that the alternative to drone warfare is even more deadly forms of warfare.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I like to think that I get a lot of stuff done.  I write on this blog nearly four times a week, I volunteer for both local and distant non-profits I like, I'm active in student organizations at college, I study a lot, and I still get my homework done.  Other people have noticed this and asked me how I'm so productive.  This essay is where I try and "share my secrets", so to speak.

The real secret is that, in the past, I wasn't nearly as productive.  I struggled with procrastination, had issues completing assignments on time, and always felt like I never had enough time to do things.  But, starting in January and continuing for the past eight months, I have slowly implemented several systems and habits in my life that, taken together, have made me productive.  Productivity is not a talent I have -- I've <i>learned</i> to be productive over the past several months and I have habits in place where I basically <i>cannot fail</i> to be productive.

Hopefully these systems will work for you.  I've seen some people adopt them to some success, but I've never seen anyone do it <i>exactly</i> the way I do.  And perhaps it would even be bad to do it exactly the way I do, because everyone is just a little bit different.  I'm <a href="http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/9v/beware_of_otheroptimizing/">being aware of other-optimizing</a> and letting you just know what's worked for me.  I make no claims that these systems will work for you.  Your mileage may vary.

So what are the systems?  To get you to be productive, we'll need to get you to <b>organize</b>, to <b>prioritize</b>, then to <b>do</b> and <b>review</b>.  Have those four things down and you'll have everything you need to be productive.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Organize</h2>
The first step to being productive <b>is to be organized and remember things without memorizing them</b>.  If we get these systems down, you won't forget your ideas, when and where events are, what tasks you need to complete, what papers you have, and what emails you have.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Most Important Rule: Write Things Down</h4>
If you only take away one system from one category, I want it to be this one.  Whole essays can be written about these systems and this one is no different -- <b>write things down</b>.  Whenever you have a cool idea, an event invitation, a task, etc., write it down.  Always.  Constantly.  No excuses.

I've found in my life that stress has come in surprising part from trying to keep everything in my head.  When I write down everything I think is worth remembering, whether it be a concrete thing I need to do or just a cool yet unimportant idea I want to follow up on sometime later, I write it down.  That gets it out of my head, and I no longer feel the need to remember things (as long as I remember to look them up later), and I feel much better.

I've also found in my life that I constantly think I'll remember something and it's not worth writing down.  More than half the time, I've been wrong and forgotten the thing.  This has meant I've forgotten cool ideas and even forgotten events or to complete key items.  Always write things down, no matter how convinced you are that you'll remember them.

<b>How do you do this?</b>  I suggest getting something that will always be with you that you can write things down on.  For the vast majority of my readers, this can be a phone where you text yourself messages.  For a long time, I would use my smartphone to email myself notes, because I knew I'd always check my email later and then could record the note to a text document.  Later on, I moved to keeping track of ideas on <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> and then later moved on to keeping track of ideas on <a href="http://www.workflowy.com">Workflowy</a>.  Workflowy costs $5 a month to use it to full potential (worth it, in my opinion), but there are free alternatives (that aren't as good, in my opinion).

However, don't shy away from the good old pen and paper if it gets the job done.  I got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008SLD3ES">this notepad</a> for $6 and it's been great.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Keep Track of Events: The Calendar</h4>
Of course, some of the things you want to write down will be particular things that need to be recorded in particularly useful places.  One of these things is <b>events</b>, or places you need to be at a particular time and place.  For this, you can use any calendar, but I like <a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a> the best.  Whenever you get invited to an event, record it on your calendar.  (We'll include reviewing your calendar regularly in a bit, so you won't forget what's there.)

A common mistake I see people make is to rely on Facebook events to keep track of their events.  Perhaps this works for some people, but not all events are done through Facebook or can be done through Facebook, so you end up keeping track of events in multiple places, which causes confusion and missed events.  Wherever you record events, <b>record all your events in one place</b>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Keep Track of Tasks: The To-Do List</h4>
<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-26-at-12.23.23-PM.png"><img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-26-at-12.23.23-PM-300x136.png" alt="Trello" width="300" height="136" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-788" /></a>
The next thing you'll want to keep track of is <b>tasks</b>.  For this, you need a to-do list.  I spent a lot of my life just using a TextEdit document, but I recommend you use a dedicated app instead.  I personally use <a href="http://www.workflowy.com">Workflowy</a> here too, but others work great.  In the past I've used <a href="http://www.trello.com">Trello</a> to great success.  I've seen others succeed with <a href="https://asana.com/">Asana</a> or even just a text document on the computer.

A common mistake I see people make here is using their email as their to-do list.  This might make some sense, but often emails contain information unnecessary to your tasks which slows you down, and sometimes emails contain multiple action points.  Worse, emails contain no easy way to prioritize tasks (which is really important and will be discussed in a bit).

Bottom line: <b>Keep all your tasks in one crisp, clear place.</b>  Don't spread out your to-do lists across multiple applications and don't put it in with a bunch of other stuff.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Action, Waiting, Reference: Stay Organized with Zones</h4>
Once you have your ideas written down, your events on your calendar, and your tasks on your to-do list, it's time to organize the materials you'll have to deal with.  Lots of physical papers and computer documents come at you throughout your day and it's time to organize them.

The trick here?  Get a surface area you can keep clear and divide it into three zones: <b>action</b>, <b>waiting</b>, and <b>reference</b>.

The <b>action zone</b> is for things that need to be done.  Have a form you need to fill out?  Something you need to read?  Even more outlandish things like a necklace you need to repair or something?  Keep everything needed for a task together in folders or with paperclips as necessary, put it in the action zone, and record the task on your to-do list.

The <b>waiting zone</b> is for things that eventually need to be done, but which cannot be done yet because you're waiting on something.  Perhaps you need feedback from someone, a package still needs to arrive, or the task only can be done on a certain day.  For this, keep everything grouped together in the waiting zone, and record on your to-do list what the task is and what you're waiting for.  (We'll revisit implementing zones in the to-do list in a little bit.)  Move things to action and update your to-do list when what you're waiting for arrives.

The <b>reference zone</b> is for things you might need to look at and need to be kept around, but are not associated with any task.  For examples, things I have had in my reference zone are passwords, details about tasks from people, items that are relevant but not necessary to the work that I'm doing, etc.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Always Inbox Zero: Apply the Folders to Your Email</h4>
Email is really messy for most people, but it doesn't have to be.  The solution here is to implement the zones in your email too.  I use <a href="http://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a>, but nearly every email system includes folders these days.  Use that system to create three folders -- action, waiting, and reference -- in your email, then sort your email according to the folders and record on your to-do list.

<b>There is no reason to have any email in your inbox</b>.  You should be at "inbox zero" <i>constantly</i>.  Whenever an email comes in, process it and file it.  Got an email from Nancy that you need to reply to?  Put it in "Action" and put "Reply to Nancy's email" on your to-do list.  Got a long email from your boss that you don't even have time to read yet?  Put it in "Action" and put "Read boss's email" on your to-do list.  Then when you go back to read it, you can determine the next action item.

Emails also make sense to be put in waiting.  If it's important I get a reply from the email, I'll put it in waiting to remind myself to follow up later if necessary (more on that later).  I'll also put emails in waiting if I'm expecting a reply from someone else first, or if it's information for an action item I can't act on yet, or if I want to reply later on.

Lastly, reference is very important for emails that you need to keep around to read, but don't need to reply to.  Lots of notes that people send me get processed into my relevant Workflowy document and then kept in reference for as long as they're relevant.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Prioritize</h2>
Now that you're all organized, it's time to get in a position to do the things you need to do.  But watch out, because unless you have time to complete your entire to-do list in one sitting, it's a poor use of time to just go from the top to the bottom.  Instead, we need to <b>go from the most important to the least important</b>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Eisenhower Matrix: Do What's Important</h4>
[caption id="attachment_793" align="alignright" width="190"]<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-26-at-12.37.51-PM.png"><img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-26-at-12.37.51-PM-190x300.png" alt="Eisenhower Matrix in Workflowy" width="190" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-793" /></a> Eisenhower Matrix in Workflowy[/caption]

How do you prioritize?  The best tactic I've seen here is called <a href="https://timegt.com/2010/07/14/what-is-the-eisenhower-matrix/">The Eisenhower Matrix</a>.  It comes from Steven Covey's book <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0684802031">First Things First</a></b> but is credited to President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Here, you take your to-do list and organize everything into four quadrants: important and urgent, important and not urgent, unimportant and urgent, and unimportant and not urgent.  This is very easy to do on Workflowy, and still possible on something like Trello.

There's pretty universal agreement that you complete all the "important and urgent" tasks first and the "unimportant and not urgent" tasks last.  But the real trick is that <b>after you complete the important and urgent tasks, you should move to complete the important and not urgent tasks.</b>  Ignore the not important and urgent tasks until you've completed all important tasks and even be comfortable with skipping unimportant tasks if necessary.  Why?  Because they're not important.

If you get this matrix down, you'll soon get ahead on your tasks, because you'll be completing important tasks <i>before they become urgent</i>.

Also, note the inclusion of "waiting" here as one of the tabs in my to-do list.  This is where I put tasks I can't complete yet with a note of what I'm waiting on.  Something like talking to my Dad three days from now would be tagged as "#30aug :: Talk to Dad" (using Workflowy hashtags), but I'd also do things with unclear dates, like "Brian responds to email :: Forward response to Seth".  Beware that being able to manage unclear deadlines (where you don't know what day the task will be) is something that most to-do list apps struggle with.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Timeboxing: Plan Your Day in Advance</h4>
[caption id="attachment_791" align="alignleft" width="208"]<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-26-at-1.04.07-PM.png"><img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-26-at-1.04.07-PM.png" alt="Timebox planning in Workflowy" width="208" height="198" class="size-full wp-image-791" /></a> Timebox planning in Workflowy[/caption]

The next prioritization thing to master is <i>planning your day in advance</i>.  You do this through making "time boxes" for things, or periods of time where you'll do something predefined.  For example, I'll set aside some time to work through my to-do list or to work on particular projects.  For bigger projects, I'll decide how much I want to work on them in any particular day or week and set them aside from my to-do list.  I'll then block out time for them on my calendar and end up with <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-26-at-1.07.28-PM.png">days like this</a>.

Since I plan my days in advance using this timebox method, I just plan every minute of the calendar in advance and have a plan so I always know what to be doing and never miss a beat.  Of course, things come up and you'll have to change your plan for the day, but that's better than having no plan at all.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Two Minute Rule</h4>
It's important to be mindful of how much time it takes to record a task, put it in your to-do list, and prioritize it, however.  For most people, including me, it's about two minutes for any given task.  This gives rise to the "two minute rule": <b>if doing somethign would take less than two minutes, just do it now.</b>  Likewise, if it would take over two minutes, put it in your to-do list and do it at the best time.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Do</h2>
Now that you have your to-do list set and timeboxes for when you're going to work and on what, it's time to actually <i>do the work</i>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Pomodoro Technique</h4>
The ideal timebox should be a length that is a multiple of thirty minutes so you can do the most powerful productivity thing there is: <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">The Pomodoro Technique</a>.  Beware that it doesn't work for some, but I do urge you to give it a fair shake and a few tries, because for those whom the Pomodoro works, the Pomodoro Technique works wonders.

Here's how you do it.  Set a timer for 25 minutes.  During those 25 minutes (a) work <b>only</b> on your task at hand; (b) <b>do not</b> do anything else, even for a second; (c) be completely focused; (d) be free from distractions; (e) and <b>do not multi-task</b>.  There are some acceptable things to do during a Pomodoro, however: go to the bathroom, drink, listen to music.  But there are tons more things not to do during a Pomodoro: check Facebook, read your email, etc.  The list will go on.

After the timer expires, take a five minute break.  During these five minutes, do anything you'd like <b>except</b> the task on hand.  Even if you feel like the break is boring and you're itching to get back on task, <b>don't</b>.  You're only hurting yourself in the long-run.  This five minute break will restore your focus, keep you grounded, provide a way to think through your ideas in a different setting, and prevent you from needing longer breaks later in the day.

It should be noted, however, that the Pomodoro can be a bit difficult to get in the habit of, though.  To solve this, I've found it useful to work my way up to the full Pomodoro by spending a month getting used to "15 minutes of work, 5 minutes break", then another month doing "20 minutes of work, 5 minutes break", and then finally "25 minutes of work, 5 minutes break".

Different people have tried other multiples besides 25 and 5, but I'm still convinced that 25-5 is the ideal split.  Perhaps 27-3 could work better for advanced Pomodoro users, but I wouldn't push it further.  I've seen things like 90-30 or <a href="http://zenhabits.net/my-fav-procrastination-hack-30-10/">30-10</a>, and all of these seem to involve working just a little too long (losing focus) and then taking a lot more break than is necessary.  Of course, if it works for you, then it works.

Here's the <a href="http://www.online-stopwatch.com/full-screen-interval-timer/?c=vxv55r3380">25-5 stopwatch</a> I use and my <a href="http://www.online-stopwatch.com/full-screen-interval-timer/?c=sxodrlz842">20-5 stopwatch</a>.  I've also liked <a href="http://tomato-timer.com/">Tomato Timer.com</a>, but any timer can work.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Be Comfortable with Breaks</h4>
The important lesson of working a lot is to be comfortable with taking a break.  The novice productive person will think it virtuous to work clear through a break and onward, thinking that he or she is making even better use of their time, defeating all those sissy workers who need breaks!  But really, this person is just setting up their own downfall, because they'll crash and burn.

Burnout is real and one of the most dangerous things you can do is <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/8gv/the_curse_of_identity/">train yourself to feel guilty about not working</a>.  So you need to remember to take breaks.  The break in a Pomodoro is a good one, but I also recommend taking a larger break (like 30 minutes) after completing three or four Pomodoros.

One particularly good break I'd like to give a shout-out to is to take a nap.  Taking a nap at a fairly regular time has <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/179882.php">health benefits</a> (see also <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000341">here</a>, <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-06/uom-wwc060106.php">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17053484">here</a>) and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11763827">doesn't harm your night sleep</a> if you nap for 20 minutes and don't nap too late in the afternoon or evening.  In fact, I've actually found naps to be a <i>time saver</i> instead of time "wasted" for a break, because I can sleep less at night and still feel rested  and be focused throughout the day.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Keep Your Energy Up</h4>
Another thing to prevent your chance of crashing and needing a long break to restore your energy is to keep your energy up.  I recommend drinking something that is somewhat sugary but not too sugary (I drink water-diluted lemonade in a 25%-75% mix) and remembering to exercise on a regular basis.  Also, <a href="http://www.nomeatathlete.com/healthy-eating/">eating healthy</a> and sleeping right works wonders for keeping your attention on your work.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Review</h2>
Of course, it's not enough to do if you're not going to learn from how you're doing and improve.  I suggest you review your life on multiple levels -- daily, weekly, monthly, and once every six months.

For the <b>daily review</b>, I keep track of whether I've <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/category/resolutions/">succeeded at certain habits</a> like exercising and eating right, and log the amount of time I've spent on various things so I can keep track of my time usage.  I also complete other relevant logs, and then spend a bit of time reflecting how things have gone for the day and think of ways to repeat successes and avoid mistakes.  I then check the plan for the next day and tweak it if necessary.  This process takes me about 15 to 20 minutes.

For the <b>weekly review</b>, I go through my action-waiting-reference zones wherever they exist (physical piles, email, and computer folders) and process them -- make sure everything there is still relevant and still belongs in the same place.  I'll remove whatever needs to be removed at this stage and remind myself what I'm working on.  I'll organize and clean anything that isn't organized at this stage and get everything together.  I'll then quickly re-read <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-strategic-plan/">my strategic plan</a> and plan out the week in accordance with my goals.  Recently, I've set amounts of time per week I want to be spending on certain projects, so it's now a matter of making a schedule that works.  This process usually takes me 45 minutes to an hour.

For the <b>monthly review</b>, I reflect on the habits I've been trying to build for the month and decide what habits I want to keep, what habits I want to add, and what habits I want to subtract.  I review how the month as a whole went and think about what I can do to repeat successes and avert future failures.  I then write up a reflection and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/category/resolutions/">publish it on my blog</a>.  This process usually takes me two hours.

For the <b>six month review</b>, I return to my goals and think about how my life trajectory as a whole is going.  What are my life goals?  What am I doing to accomplish them?  Am I closer to my goals than I was six months ago?  Should I be working toward new goals?  What common mistakes did I make through the past six months that I want to avoid?  I then <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-strategic-plan/">write a document</a> with my personal mission and goals for the next six months and skim it every week to constantly remind myself of what I want to be doing.  This process usually takes me three hours.

Yes, there will be an unlucky day where you do all four reviews and spend like six and a half hours reviewing your life at different levels.  Perhaps this is a bit much for people, but I've found tremendous benefit from it.  I've found that spending this day reviewing my life has saved me from not just days, but even months, of wasted time that doesn't accomplish what I really want to do.  <b>Reviewing is another way of saving you time.</b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Additional Tips</h2>
Now I've given you all my main advice, but I have some additional tips if you want to keep reading.

<b>Carefully form these habits over time.</b>  This is a lot to do at once, so do it in stages.  Build the habit of writing things down first, and then slowly get the apps you like in place for ideas, events, and tasks.  After you have that down, spend the time necessary to get your email in order and implement the zones wherever possible.  Then begin to move into prioritizing your tasks with the Eisenhower Matrix.  After you have this down, begin planning your days in advance with timeboxes and start doing your reviews.  While you're building that habit, simultaneously start building up the Pomodoro habit, slowly approaching 25-5 over a few months.

<b>Find a way to reliably stay on habit.</b>  Don't make the common failure of sticking to something for a month or two and abandoning it.  Spend a lot of energy thinking through how you'll stay on habit and how you'll not be like all the other people who think they'll stay on habit then fail.  <a href="http://hackthesystem.com/blog/the-bet-switch-mechanism-the-one-simple-tactic-that-will-make-you-lose-weight-eat-right-and-get-in-the-best-shape-of-your-life/">Make a bet with a friend</a>, <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">start up Beeminder</a>, or create some other kind of commitment device.

<b>Form the productivity mindset.</b> I had a lot of trouble implementing this plan until I was able to think of myself as an important person who does important things and should personally value my time.  I had to really want to be productive before I could start being productive.  Success at this will follow from the right mindset.  It's time to start thinking of yourself as important.  If you can't fool yourself, maybe it's time to look at your goals and decide what goals would make you feel important and then <i>do those goals instead</i>.

<b>Behold the power of routines.</b> I find it a lot easier to exercise if I have a routine of "every other day, right after waking up" or "every other day, right before dinner".  Your routine can be built from here.  It's a lot easier to stick to timeboxes if they're regularly occurring.  Use a calendar and build yourself something nice.

<b>Put everything in a particular place.</b>  People lose a lot of time just hunting around for things.  Solve this by spending some time ahead of time organizing things in your life and getting them into particular places.  Then always make sure things return to their places.

<b>Declutter your life.</b>  You'll work better if you have less stuff to keep track of and less commitments to worry about.  Get rid of everything and delegate anything you can.

<b>Make a productivity place.</b>  This works especially well in colleges where there is a large variety of places you could be working.  Find a place to work, set up your Pomodoros, and follow them to the letter.  Don't mess up.  Take your longer breaks somewhere else.  If you do mess up, find a new productivity place and start again.  I found this really helpful for my mindset, but others have found it silly.

<b>Don't neglect friends and family.</b>  This is a big one.  Remember, the goal of being more productive is to free time to do the things you want and be with the people you want.  It's not to spend 100 hour workweeks neglecting those who are important to you.  Make sure to take some time off to spend with friends and family.  Schedule it in your calendar if you have to.  This will matter most in the long-run for your life.

<b>Productivity ≠ Busy and Busy ≠ Productivity.</b>  If you do productivity right, you shouldn't feel busy all that often.  Being busy is a sign of having poor productivity and/or having taken on too many commitments, and is rarely ever a sign of doing things correctly.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
These tips are really a result of me experimenting for eight months.  I'd expect you to take a similar amount of time to go from zero to productive and end up with different systems that work for you and your environment.  But I think there are a lot of power in these systems and I'm interested to see what other people do and how other people run with them.  After all, <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/">they work for <i>me</i></a>.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have to distinguish between two types of task. 

One is the pure "doing" task where I have all the necessary components to hand and I just have to get on with it. For example paying a bill, or a household chore. Being organised with check lists, to-do lists and all that Peter has mentioned is a great help here.

The second is a creative task where some thought is required and, above all, the Muse needs to be present. I find that I put off doing this sort of task for as long as I can, sometimes getting quite cross with myself for not getting on with it. I may even dream about the due date arriving and not having completed the task. But then mysteriously the Muse arrives, the creativity flows and the task is readily done.

My theory about this second type is that my subconscious is working away, both in waking and in sleeping periods, doing the background work that eventually produces the creative moment when the whole affair is given birth. This "unorganised" , or perhaps I should say "disorganised", approach works for me though there have been a few close shaves with deadlines!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I got a surprising amount from this! ("Surprising" not because I didn't think it would be good, but because I would have expected to have picked up on ~95% of it from other rationalists/effective altruists already.)

Things that work differently for me:
- I probably write things down too much and think about my life plan too much (N.B. these are rare problems!). I've always had an inclination to record absolutely everything but I'm starting to realize that I'm spending too much time writing and organizing notes and not enough time thinking. And I only look at my life plan once every three months, rather than every week, because I think I change course too often and think about broader effective altruism issues more often than is helpful.
- I don't find having a specific waiting "zone" useful, but it is one of my many tags.
- WorkFlowy seems better than Asana, but I won't endure the switching costs until WorkFlowy has a significantly better Android app than Asana.
- I don't put my daily routine in my calendar hour-by-hour. Instead, I have an "all day" event which has an outline of what I want to do in the description. I think that my plans change so often that having a default starting time and order for my daily routine would annoy me because I'd have to adjust it so often.
- I now do daily, fortnightly (every two weeks) and quarterly (every three months) reviews.
- Commitment devices have yet to work for me because I always just get out of it.

Things that I'm finding difficult:
- Getting into the habit of pomodoros. I find everything about them difficult.
- Not procrastinating.]]></wp:comment_content>

				<title>Pitching &quot;Effective Altruism&quot;?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm interested in an idea called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">effective altruism"</a> which is about not just doing things to make the world a better place, but about thinking about what can do to make their helping go the <i>furthest</i>.  For example, if I could spend an hour and help a person cross the street that would be cool, but if I could spend an hour and cure blindness in three different people, that would be <i>even cooler</i>.

Generally, it seems like people either immediately get "effective altruism" or they don't.  Evidence from <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> member surveys plus other anecdotal evidence seems to support this. But as the "effective altruism" movement is going to grows, we'll eventually run out of those who find the idea intuitive and we'll need to start pitching to people who find the idea unintuitive.  How do we do this?<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Two days ago, I went on a volunteering trip with some fellow college students to a local non-profit organization.  We arrived at their building and proceeded to help them clean their air vents, tables, chairs, walls, and ceiling fans.  And then we left.

There were seven of us and we were all there cleaning for an hour each.  However, imagine that, instead of volunteering ourselves, we paid a janitor minimum wage to do the cleaning instead.  I suspect that the janitor would accomplish our tasks in less than seven hours given that the janitor is more trained and will require less oversight and explanation of the task from the management.  Hiring a janitor is simply much more efficient than continuing to get confused college students to do the volunteering.

The work for the Salvation Army probably wasn't "effective" by this definition.  But it was interesting to see how people who aren't interested in "effective altruism" (or haven't considered the idea) think about the topic.  I didn't confront anyone with my views, but I asked them a little bit about what they thought.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The other people who were there seemed to believe that...

<ul>
<li>One ought to benefit their "local" community (the relatively poor city next to our college) instead of further away communities (like the developing world), even when those further away communities are in more need.</li>
<li>One can't help these further away communities, because one doesn't understand the issues there or "what the people want".</li>
<li>The best way to help people is to get to know them on a personal basis first and "understand the problem".</li>
<li>Volunteering is far more important than donating money (or spending a similar amount of time working and then donating that money).</li>
<li>Paying someone else to accomplish what you'd do when you volunteer is "cheating" or evading personal responsibility, similar to paying someone to take your math test.</li>
<li>The personal experience of volunteering for the volunteer is as important as the personal experience for the people who are helped.</li>
<li>Getting at the "root cause" of a problem is far more important than doing something to address a symptom (for example, some people considered it better to spend time achieving political change addressing economic inequality than directly feed a hungry person).</li>
<li>The idea of "maximizing one's impact" makes some sense, but doesn't imply things like helping the developing world (or helping nonhuman animals or reducing existential risk).</li>
</ul>

These believes seem somewhat incorrect, mistaken, or incomplete to me.  Moreover, the fact that these beliefs are incomplete is <i>obvious</i> to me.  But I think that even I believed all of these things at some point in my life.  They're just... <i>intuitive</i>.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<blockquote>What’s the member survey evidence?</blockquote>

It's a study done by Joey Savoie on why people joined Giving What We Can.  I don't think it's available to the public or that I can make it available, but you could consider contacting either him or GWWC.

~

<blockquote>And what does it mean for someone to “not get” effective altruism? Like, what behaviors would you count as “not getting” it?</blockquote>

People "get it" in so far as they self-report to finding key EA ideals "obvious".  Many people in the member survey were on board with (a) give lots and (b) give effectively from reading just a little Peter Singer and report having just never thought of it before.

People don't "get it" in so far as this self-report doesn't happen.  Some people read Peter Singer and generate numerous objections.  In my experience, this people are really difficult to "reach".]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, it's difficult for me to comment on the actual data you cited since it's not public (aren't we supposed to value transparency or something?), but there are a lot of confounding factors here:
- the obvious sampling bias with the GWWC member survey
- people who "get it" most and least will be the most vocal
- your measure of "getting" it seems to be pretty much binary, so this isn't actually evidence of a bimodal distribution of "EA-convertability"

I've observed many instances of the opposite anecdotal evidence from yours (and indeed, am one): people reading/hearing about Singer/EA, initially dismissing the ideas and gradually coming around.

Maybe some of your anecdotal experience happened because your sample is mostly people that you've actively tried to convince of EA. Studies of political beliefs (to which EA is somewhat analogous; I have a hunch it triggers political styles of argument in many people) show that making strong counterarguments causes people to become more, not less, entrenched in their position, so pitching to people directly tends to have a polarizing effect.

For this reason I think working hard at direct pitching isn't very high return. What seems to work better is just being vocal about one's EA activities, without trying to engage people one-on-one. When I do get into debates about e.g. utilitarianism, they're much more effective in convincing onlookers than convincing the person I'm debating.]]></wp:comment_content>

Right.  Unfortunately there's nothing I can do about that.

Right, there are limitations present.  But it's at least a start at seeing a trend and is better than anecdotal evidence from one person's experience.  Further work would need to be done to see if this is true.

<blockquote><b>Ben:</b> Maybe some of your anecdotal experience happened because your sample is mostly people that you’ve actively tried to convince of EA.</blockquote>

This isn't the case as I generally don't actively try to convince people of EA.

I tend to agree here.  But Giving What We Can intends to do events regardless, so the question of pitching is still and interesting and relevant one.

I agree that it fits.  But, of course, no one would ever admit that this is their goal.]]></wp:comment_content>

The minimum wage actually (1) doesn't cover everyone, (2) doesn't stay the same unless Congress changes it, (3) obviously increase unemployment when raised, (4) or help the working poor when raised. It also (5) isn't a partisan issue.

Need more myths?  Ok.  Here's <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5895140/10-stubborn-exercise-myths-that-wont-die-debunked-by-science">10 Stubborn Exercise Myths That Won't Die</a>.  Turns out things like "No Pain, No Gain" is false, soreness after exercise isn't caused by lactic acid building up in muscles, exercise doesn't have to take long hours and isn't worthless if you don't do it regularly, you don't need a sports drink or supplements, you actually shouldn't stretch, you will lose weight but you won't lose weight quickly.  Furthermore, exercising when you're old is still fine even if you didn't do it when young, and working out in your home isn't better or worse than working out at the gym.

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/03/if-you-pay-them-money-partisans-will-tell-you-the-truth/">If you pay them money, partisans will tell you the truth</a>.  There has been a surprising finding that political partisans don't just disagree on the issues, but also basic facts like the level of unemployment.  However, this theory suggests that they don't actually disagree, they're just essentially lying to show support for their preferred side.  If you offer them money to give a correct answer, this partisan effect disappears.  ...At least in one study.

<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gz/policy_debates_should_not_appear_onesided/">"Policy Debates Should Not Appear One-Sided"</a>: "Arguments are soldiers.  Once you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it's like stabbing your soldiers in the back.  If you abide within that pattern, policy debates will also appear one-sided to you—the costs and drawbacks of your favored policy are enemy soldiers, to be attacked by any means necessary."

<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/6py/optimal_philanthropy_for_human_beings/">"Optimal Philanthropy for Human Beings"</a>: "The psychology of charitable giving offers three pieces of advice to those who want to give charity and those who want to receive it: Enjoy the happiness that giving brings, commit future income, and realize that requesting time increases the odds of getting money."

<b>"A mere five decades ago, we thought that only white people deserved the front of the bus.  A mere century ago, we thought that woman were too stupid to vote.  Two centuries ago, we thought that only land-owning white men mattered and native americans were things to be killed.  Four centuries ago, we thought that rule by kings was the best way to arrange a government and that our opinions about how the universe was created should be spread by swords.  We've come a long way, but it makes you wonder what things we're doing wrong that will take decades more to uncover."</b><!--more-->

<b>"In a society in which the narrow pursuit of material self-interest is the norm, the shift to an ethical stance is more radical than many people realize. In comparison with the needs of people starving in Somalia, the desire to sample the wines of the leading French vineyards pales into insignificance. Judged against the suffering of immobilized rabbits having shampoos dripped into their eyes, a better shampoo becomes an unworthy goal. An ethical approach to life does not forbid having fun or enjoying food and wine, but it changes our sense of priorities."</b> -- Peter Singer

<b>"There is no community-service requirement in the real world; no one is forcing you to care. You can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and go chasing after the big house and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says that you should want, that you should aspire to, that you can buy. But I hope you don’t walk away from the challenge. Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition.”</b> -- President Obama

<b>"The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you."</b> -- Neil DeGrasse Tyson

				<title>Should We Tell People That Giving Makes Them Happier?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Why do people give to charity?

It seems strange to even ask. Most people would point to the fact that they’re altruistic and want to make a difference. Others are concerned with inequality and justice. Another group points to the concept of “paying it forward” or repaying a debt to society. Other explanations cite various religious or social reasons.

Not too many people cite the fact that giving makes them happier. Even if people agree this is true, I don’t often hear it as people’s main reason. Instead, it’s more like a beneficial side effect. In fact, it seems pretty odd to me to hear someone boldly proclaim that they give only because it makes them happier, even if it might be true.

But if it’s true that giving does make people happier, should we be promoting that publicly and loudly? Perhaps it might make a great opportunity to tap into groups who wouldn’t consider giving otherwise or have misconceptions that giving would make them miserable? I’m a bit worried about how it might affect people’s incentives.

In this essay, I follow the evidence provided in the Harvard Business School working paper <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6272.html">“Feeling Good About Giving: The Benefits (and Costs) of Self-Interested Charitable Behavior”</a> by Lalin Anik, Lara B. Aknin, Michael I. Norton, and Elizabeth W. Dunn. Overall, in light of potential incentive effects, I think caution and further investigation is warranted when promoting the happiness side of giving.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Giving and Happiness</h2>
Giving What We Can has published its own review of research on happiness and giving and find a pretty strong connection. And it’s true -- lots of evidence confirms the connection and even indicates that it’s a causal relationship rather than a misleading correlation. In fact, it goes in both directions -- giving makes people happier and happier people are more likely to give[1].

Neurological studies of people found that people experienced pleasure when they saw money go to charity, even when it wasn’t their own, but experienced even more pleasure when they gave to charity directly[2], a conclusion that has been backed up with revealed preference tests in the lab[3, 4].

This connection has also been backed up in numerous experimental studies. Asking people to commit random acts of kindness can significantly increase self-reported levels of happiness compared to a control group[5]. Further research found that the amount people spent on gifts for others and donations to charity correlates with their self-reported happiness, while the amount they spent on bills, expenses, and gifts for themselves did not[6]. Additionally, people given money and randomly assigned to spend money on others were happier than those randomly assigned to spend the same amount of money on themselves[7].

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Altering Incentives</h2>
<p>People generally believe that spending on themselves will make them much happier than spending on others[6], which, given that this isn’t the case, means there is plenty of room for changing people’s minds. However, any social scientist or avid reader of Freakonomics knows that altering incentives can create unintended effects. So is there a potential harm in getting people to do more giving via advertising self-interested motive?

The classic example is that of the childcare center that had problems with parents who were late to pick up their children. They reasoned that if they charged fines, parents would stop being late, because they would have an economic incentive not to. They found instead, however, that introducing a fine actually created even more tardiness[8], presumably because what once was seen as rude and bad faith now could be made up for with a small economic cost. More surprisingly, the amount of lateness did not return to pre-fine levels even after the owners stopped the policy[9].

Other studies have found similar effects. A study of 3-5 year old nursery students who all initially seemed intrinsically interested in various activities were randomly put into three groups. One group made a pre-arranged deal to do a one of the activities in which they seemed interested in exchange for a reward, another group was surprised with a reward after doing the activity in question, and the third group was not rewarded at all. Those who were given an award upfront ended up significantly less intrinsically interested in the task than the other groups after the study was finished[10]. A similar study found that students who were interested in solving puzzles stopped solving those puzzles after a period ended where they were paid to solve puzzles[11].
<p>&nbsp;</p>
In general, money and reminders of money tend to make people less pro-social[12]. This has also been found to some degree specifically in the world of charity. In a randomized field experiment, donors were encouraged to donate to disaster relief in the US and were randomly either enticed with an offer of donation matching or not. The study found that while people donated more often with the promise of donation matching, their contributions after the donation matching dropped below the control group, ending with a negative net effect overall[13].

Another study found that when gifts were sent out to donors, larger gifts resulted in a larger response rate of returned donations, but yielded a smaller average donation[14], though I suppose this could just be because more people who usually would give nothing were giving a small amount, bringing the average down. More importantly, this study found no net decrease in future donations after gifts were no longer sent out; instead, donations returned to their normal levels[14].

And certainly it’s worth noting some times when appeals to self-interest are successful. I couldn’t find any studies where this was the case. However, there is one anecdotal example: as Nick Cooney points out in <a href="http://qz.com/91716/self-interest-can-make-the-world-a-better-place-for-animals-at-least/">“Self-Interest Can Make the World a Better Place -- For Animals, At Least”</a>, reduction in people eating factory farmed meat is coming almost entirely from people motivated not by concern for animal cruelty, but concern for their own health. Could advocating self-interested donations be the same as advocating health-motivated vegetarianism?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Opportunities for Further Investigation</h2>
It’s not very good to just let things be unclear if they don’t have to be, and I think we can resolve this issue with more scientific study. For example, one could randomly select one group to receive information about giving and happiness, another group to receive other standard arguments for giving, and a control group to receive no arguments or information about giving at all, and track their donation habits in a longitudinal study. This study would have it’s complications for sure, but could help see if information about giving and happiness backfires or not.

Or perhaps one could perform a field experiment. You could set up a booth asking people to donate to your cause and randomly include information about giving and happiness or not in your pitch and see how this affects immediate and long-term contributions. Doing this would have added advantages of being much quicker to run and not leading to people donating only because they think they’re being observed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Continued from <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-plan/">"My Careers Plan"</a>.</i>

As I continue the third week of the school year, I have 7 months and 29 days until I graduate and need a "Thing To Do After I Graduate"(TM) in order to qualify for "The Real World"(TM).  Earlier, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-plan/">I outlined a plan</a> to try and get a career that would lead me on a path "that will, taken as a whole, contribute the most to the world with regard to my utilitarian goals to increase total well-being".

I recognize that my first career very likely won't be my only career or even the place I spent all that much time at.  But it's important that I have a "first step" or "five year plan" to figure out where I'm supposed to be pointed at in order to make this well-being maximization thing actually happen.

So where should I point?  I've narrowed it down to approximately five broad categories.  In no particular order, they are: law school, graduate school, computer programming, market research, or non-profit work.  I say "approximately" because these categories can be combined in some ways to make new opportunities.

Here's the details.  Sorry it's long, but it's a complicated question and I have a lot of thoughts.  I really appreciate all those people who have taken the time to slog through this with me and give me valuable advice.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My Methodology</h2>
The methodology I followed was the following:
<ol>
<li>Decided on what general values and criteria I wanted to uphold in pursuing career choice (effective altruism).</li>
<li>Created as comprehensive of a list as I could of careers that fit my general values and criteria (<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-plan/">see here</a>).</li>
<li>Solicited feedback on this list generally.</li>
<li>Broke down the careers and identified people I respect in those careers I could talk to.  I then asked them (26 different people so far) specific questions.  I also asked them about opportunities not on my list.</li>
<li>Processed and aggregated their responses into a Workflowy document.</li>
<li>Reviewed their responses and my thoughts and narrowed down the list.</li>
<li>Synthesized everything into what you see here.</li>
</ol>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What's Currently Out and Why</h2>
I had previously entertained some other career options, but I've decided that I really do need to narrow some things down in order to focus particularly on areas I find more promising -- I'm worried enough that I'm spreading myself too thin even with just five options.  So here's why I got rid of some options.

<b>Investment Banking / Finance:</b> This career is the highest earning that is feasible to get into as a graduate (and therefore offer the most to donate), but from what I've experienced of it, I don't think the job and social environment of it are a good fit for me.  Also, I have not done the things that are generally considered necessary to prepare for it (have a very relevant major and do an internship or two in finance).  Overall, I probably could make an effort to try and get into this field, but it just doesn't appeal to me.

<b>Consulting:</b> Consulting seems like it could have promisingly high salaries with even higher earning potential down the road.  But the consulting jobs I would have access to, assuming I could get them, are all extremely high travel.  As someone who values stable routines in predictable places and doesn't like to travel, this would annoy me a lot.  Therefore, this job is just not going to be for me.

<b>Startups:</b> Startups might have an even higher earning potential than finance, though this seems highly uncertain.  I just don't feel passionate about trying to make this happen, though, and I think that's exceptionally critical for startup success.  I don't have any good ideas for startups or really any particular aptitude in this area.

<b>Journalism:</b> I think I'm a good writer and could have an opportunity to influence people through journalism.  However, I have a low expectation that people would actually read my material and change their mind.  Moreover, I think it's important for journalism that you already be famous for some other reason before you'll get picked up by major publications.  For now, I'll just stick to writing in my blog and around the internet, but be open to these opportunities if they present themselves.



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Option #1: Law School</h2>
Besides maybe finances and startups, corporate law probably has the highest potential earnings out of any career.  Once you finish three years of law school, I'm told by a bunch of people that if you go to a good enough law school and do well enough, you could get hired into a job at $160K.  Yes, this job is in New York and yes the lifestyle of the lawyer is a bit higher spending, but I'd be very surprised if I couldn't donate $80K or more a year off of the base salary.

Add to that the fact that there are bonuses of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/cravath-announces-bonus-scale-2012-11">$10K-$60K</a> and there's even more to donate.  Best of all, if one does well enough to make partner or counsel in the firm, one could potentially make $300K to $3M a year after 15-20 years of being in law.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Why am I interested in law?</b>

Well, besides getting lots of money for altruistic purposes, I do find the actual subject matter interesting.  This is what makes the law, for me, very different from finance (where I don't care much).  I did Mock Trial for all four years in high school and did Moot Court for all four years in college, even making it as far as the first round of Moot Court Nationals last year.  I enjoy reading court cases and think I would also enjoy other aspects of the law.  I also think I have decent aptitude in this area, though it's a bit hard to tell.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What are my chances of getting into a top 10 law school?</b>

Admissions to law school seem pretty straightforward based on college GPA, LSAT score, and a little bit of consideration given to other things like race, in state status (if a state school), your personal statement, and extracurricular activities you've done in college.  From here, you can see <a href="http://www.top-law-schools.com/rankings.html">a list of top schools and quartiles for GPA and LSAT</a> and even <a href="http://www.hourumd.com/">derive a probability calculator based on past results</a>.

Currently, I have a GPA of 3.5, which is great, but not stellar top school material, putting me at maybe the range of top 25 schools.  Right now, my LSAT scores on practice tests are coming in at 166, which puts me in the range of top 15 schools.  The calculator suggests I have a little bit below even odds of getting into a top 10 school right now.  I'm personally hoping that, between now and the time I take the LSAT, I'll find a way to boost my score up a little bit more.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What are my chances of getting a high-income job, given getting into a top 10 law school?</b>

I'm told by quite a few people that the standard $160K law jobs recruit lots of people from top 10 schools, so if you've made it to the top 10 law school, you can pretty easily make it into the law job, provided you don't burn out in law school.  For non-top-10 schools, this probably isn't the case, which is why I want to focus so heavily on getting into a top 10 school.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>How likely would I be to continue in law, given that I get into it?</b>

The biggest risk I see to law school is that I get as far as being in a law job and then either (a) hate it and want to quit or (b) get fired.  The social environment of the law job seems like it could be quite like that of finance.  I'm personally not an exceedingly outgoing person and dislike "going to the bar", so I might not fit in with what are the stereotypical backslapping law types.  But I have seen quite a few successful lawyers that don't fit that stereotype.

I know the hours of law are quite ruthless.  I'm not sure how well I'd do with that.  I'm already used to working <i>quite a lot</i> (averaging an 81 hour workweek), but never on <i>the same task</i>.  I like varied work, and law might not provide that. I've heard anecdotal evidence that the law environment is difficult for altruistic tendencies to survive and thrive.

It's possible that law could get me into other high-paying careers, but this route is not ideal.  Given the time and money costs of law school, I think I should go only if I intend to be a lawyer basically forever.
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>How much of a concern is the three-year delay of going to law school?</b>

The biggest issue people bring up to me is the delay involved in going to law school for three years (and potentially more delay with debt repayment).  I think this is a serious concern, but not for the reasons people think.  Most people seem driven to reject this with the haste consideration -- thinking that getting money now is more important than getting even more money later.  But the salaries for law are double or more what I could make through any other route and I think that more than makes up for the pause.  I think the haste consideration matters, but <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/practical-limits-to-giving-now-and-the-haste-consideration/">maybe not all that much</a>.  We only can spend money so quickly and it would also be good to have more later.

What is a concern, however, is the amount of time and money that needs to be invested in a career that might not work out well.  This is potentially high-risk and I should aim to be very sure that law is a good path for me.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Option #2: Graduate School</h2>
I used to really want to be a college professor because I thought it would be a really fun and personally satisfying job, and I think I have a lot of aptitude in this area.  I still think that, but I'm concerned that the possibilities for impact are, while not low in an absolute sense, lower than I would like.  I've become recently concerned that people tend not to read academic research or put it to good use, and that's when the research is actionable, useful, and practical in the first place, which it generally isn't.

There might be some opportunities to do useful research that could make an impact on the world and there might be other benefits to being a professor, like writing a bestselling book and getting a lot of influence, but these opportunities seem very unlikely and happen only to a select few highly skilled and highly lucky people.

I still see it as a really good fit for me personally, even if it might not be the highest impact.  Additionally, I think there's a chance that getting a masters in something like statistics could open up some high-paying jobs that are very relevant to where I see my interests and skills lying.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Could the concerns of irrelevance be addressed?</b>

I think this is a possibility, but I'm worried that it is unlikely.  Some research in psychology seems rather relevant to effective altruism, like Paul Slovic's work on <a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/journal/7303a/jdm7303a.htm">how people think about charity</a> or Tversky and Kahneman's <a href="http://www.cog.brown.edu/courses/cg195/pdf_files/fall05/CG195TverskyKahn1974.pdf">work on biases</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Could I get the benefits of graduate school without going to graduate school?</b>

It seems somewhat plausible that any studies I'd want to run for their impact value, I could run without needing to be a graduate student, perhaps through <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon's Mechanical Turk</a> or go to work doing research for an existing EA organization -- and probably accomplish both with far more academic freedom and less hassle.  What I would miss, however, would be the skills development and credentials that come with graduate school, as well as the nearly unlimited supply of undergraduate research participants.  But it's possible I could do research as direct work in an EA org, or on the side of a different earning to give career.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>How likely would I be to get into a desired graduate program?  How likely would I be to secure a good future based on being in a desired graduate program?</b>

I don't currently have good answers to these programs, but my initial thoughts are the chances are perhaps above 50%.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What is my chance of burning out or abandoning this idea prematurely?</b>
I've heard a lot about graduate school burnout.  So far, I've gone through four years of college without tiring much for academic curiosity and willingness to do lots of research.  I could see this passion continuing very easily if I were in the right graduate program.  But, like law school, I run some risk of wasting time and money, though not as much because monetary costs should be <i>much</i> lower.



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Option #3: Computer Programming</h2>
I don't currently have any credentialed training in computer science, but it seems like the skills can be picked up by doing things like <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Codeschool</a> and working on projects.  And then, to land the job, you just need demonstrate the technical skills on the white board in your interview.  Then, to keep the job, you just need to have learned what to do.  No official schooling required, unless you're shooting for a top job.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What's the expected salary in computer programming?</b>

Computer programming has decently sized incomes that one can get right out of college, but it's a bit complicated, since it will depend on your skills and years of experience.   One person suggests that average Ruby / Python programmers can land $70-80k in most cities, with the notable exception of NYC and San Francisco.  Another person suggests that I'd probably start at $60K-80K or something and then reach $100K in a few years, and maybe $125K-$150K in 5-10 years.  A third person places the average at $45k-$60k for an entry-level inexperienced Ruby programmer.  A fourth person says the average might be $80k for a generic entry-level programmer.

Jeff Kaufman, <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/money">who publishes his compensation over time</a>, started at about $66K plus bonuses and donation matching, four years later now has $160K plus bonuses (>$15K) and donation matching (~$12K).

An analysis of <a href="http://bpodgursky.wordpress.com/2013/08/21/average-income-per-programming-language/">average salaries across all programming languages</a> puts Ruby at $98K, but doesn't give data specifically for my level of (in)experience.  Furthermore, I expect any salary by programming language to be a snapshot in time that doesn't matter much, because trends in programming change quickly and it's relatively easy (I believe) to change programming languages as it suits you.

It's possible that doing a coding bootcamp, like <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> or <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com/">Launch Academy</a> might boost salaries.  I heard from one person who went into programming with little initial skills starting at a salary of $45k.  He then spent time at Launch Academy and exited with a salary of $75k.  Given that these programs are just a few months, this seems pretty promising.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What are my chances of getting these salaries?</b>

I think it's unclear.  I'd expect to exist on the low end of salaries and have to work my way up.  I think I have natural talent at programming, but am still very much a beginner at something like Ruby on Rails and still have quite a ways to go in my knowledge of JavaScript.  I can keep practicing, but I have lots of other obligations and can't devote as much time as I would like.  Could I learn enough in 8 months to land a job?  I don't know.  Would it be worth it to keep going until I do know enough to land a job?  I don't know.

I've been encouraged by almost a half dozen people to "stick with" programming and I'll keep at it because I trust them as a collective source of wisdom.  But I personally see this as a quite a long shot.



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Option #4: Direct EA Volunteering / Work</h2>
Another very compelling option is to not donate to organizations I like, but to work for them directly instead.  I can think of doing this in two ways: as a volunteer dedicating free time left over after doing a different job or as a staff member (or intern) in the organization itself.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What kind of direct additional value, if any, could I provide in direct EA work?</b>

I say "additional" value because I want to make sure I'm better than <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/replaceability-thinking-on-the-margin">my hypothetical replacement</a> -- that is, if I decided not to apply for the job, would the person hired in my place do just about as good or do substantially worse?  The difference in my performance and the performance of this hypothetical replacement is what is of concern to me.

However, I think my experience at my <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> internship showed that I actually could have promise in this kind of organization.  I seem better at both writing and research than many other people in the EA movement who would potentially compete for my spot.  I'm also widely knowledgeable about "EA theory".  I'd consider myself conscientious and self-directed enough to do a good job.

I think I'm still unproven in some other areas like management (though I have lead some pretty stellar college organizations).  It's quite plausible that I'd want to get experience somewhere else first, not only to prove myself more, but to develop more skills and also build a broader résumé in case I want to do something else.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Which is better -- full-time work or volunteering?</b>

Full-time work seems more promising at first for a few reasons: I'm more directly involved with the organization and what it's doing, have more opportunities to influence the organization to be better, have more opportunities to learn from being there, and am in a great environment.  It seems like if I think that direct work is actually higher impact, I should want to do as much of it as I can, right?

However, there could be a few great reasons to just volunteer instead: I could do it remotely from anywhere I'd like, I could do it while doing another job (and earn to give at the same time), I could work for a wide variety of organizations at once, and I'd have more control over what projects I'd do.  This seems like a good idea if I want flexibility and I want to keep options open as to both direct work and doing more earning to give.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>How likely would I be to get a permanent staff position in an EA organization?</b>

This seems to be a difficult question.  EA positions seem quite competitive and there are very few of them.  Moreover, several of the organizations I like are located in England, where it would be very difficult to get work authorization there, as I am a US Citizen.

I still could work for American organizations like Effective Animal Activism, The Humane League, or GiveWell (I'm much less interested in other options), but I know much less about how one obtains full-time positions in any of these organizations.  On the other hand, arranging volunteering opportunities has been exceedingly easy to date.



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Option #5: Market Research</h2>
Through college, I've picked up a strong statistics background, and I think market research could be a particularly good fit for this.  I think this mainly because I've seen other people at my university who graduated before me with very similar interests and talents do the same thing and end up liking it (though they weren't focused as much on the "total well-being" thing).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What are the salaries in market research like?</b>

In a few words: not as amazing.  I actually know less about this than I should.  A lot of the current salaries on <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com">Glassdoor</a> seem to hover in the $50K range, possibly going up as high as $90K after a fair amount of time in the company.  This is lower compared to, say, law and probably much lower than I could make even in programming with comparably less options for salaries to rise with advancement, but still high compared to other options out of college as an undergraduate.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Why focus on market research then?</b>

Essentially, I expect to like it, find it to fit with my passions and skills, and get good skill development out of it.  It seems like a very good career to also do volunteering on the side, as discussed in the previous option.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
In the next essay, I'll lay out my preferred framework for comparing careers, compare these five options, come to some initial conclusions, and outline what I still need to know and my next steps.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Continuation of <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/i-now-have-approximately-five-career-categories/">"I Now Have Approximately Five Career Categories"</a>.</i>

<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/i-now-have-approximately-five-career-categories/">Earlier</a>, I outlined approximately five things I'd consider as my post-college career: grad school, law school, market research, computer programming, and working directly for an effective altruist organization.

But which one should I pick?  I don't actually know yet.  In the end, I can only pick one of the five to start with (though I probably could switch easily if I needed to.)  So I thought I would attempt to compare these careers across a few different categories, see what happens, and then outline some questions I still have and my next steps.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My Dimensions of Career Comparison</h2>
After talking it over with a few people, here are the dimensions I've developed to compare careers.  (Note that here I'm using "career" very generically to refer to any post-collegiate opportunity.)

<b>Skills:</b> This speaks to the quantity and quality of the personal, transferrable skills one develops by doing the career.  A career high in "skills" should prepare you to be better at doing other careers down the road.

<b>Network:</b> This speaks to the personal contacts you would develop through the career.  Could you have the opportunity to network with people who could help you a lot down the road?

<b>"CV Points":</b> This speaks to how well the career would look on your CV or résumé to future employers.  It's essentially how "impressive" the career is.  It can also refer to the credentials you earn through the career.

<b>Direct Impact:</b> This speaks to the amount you can improve the world specifically and directly by doing your career.  (Technically, all these other measures are supposed to be measures of indirect impact.)

<b>Earnings:</b> This speaks to how much you would earn through the career.  This includes salary, bonuses, and other relevant perks.

<b>Information Value:</b> This speaks to how much the career would teach you about the general opportunities for you in the world and improve the quality of your future career choices.

<b>Option Value:</b> This speaks to how well the career "keeps your options open".  A career with low option value might keep you on a track to one particular career and make switching difficult or costly.

<b>Costs:</b> This speaks to how monetarily expensive it would be to get a start in this career.

<b>Risk:</b> This speaks to how much risk you would take on in the career.  Is there a chance of failure?  If so, would failure be disastrous to you?

<b>Enjoyment:</b> This speaks to how much you personally would enjoy performing the career.  Would it be a fun opportunity, an annoying one, or somewhere in between?

<b>Replaceability:</b> This speaks to how good you think you would be at the career, relative to other people in that same role.  Are you just doing something which someone else could easily take your place and do the same?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Law School, Compared</h2>
<b>General Idea:</b> Go to law school for three years, then get a job in corporate law, and continue to earn lots of money and donate as much of it as I can.

<b>Skills:</b> 2/5.  I would develop a great knowledge of the law.  I also imagine I'd develop general skills relating to analysis and research.  But not much else, I think.

<b>Network:</b> 4/5.  Presumably top law schools have really good connections, but those connections might be narrow to just law.

<b>CV Points:</b> 4/5.  Presumably a JD looks pretty good on a CV.

<b>Direct Impact:</b> 0/5.  I don't think my job would directly make people's lives <i>worse</i>, but it's difficult to imagine corporate law really making things go better.

<b>Earnings:</b> 5/5. $160K per year at minimum, several million per year at maximum.

<b>Information Value:</b> 2/5.  I'd learn if I want to do law...

<b>Option Value:</b> 0/5 (lower means more restrictive).  Law school basically is only profitable if you want to be a lawyer for a long time.

<b>Costs:</b> 0/5 (lower means more expensive).  Law school is going to be my most personally expensive option by far.

<b>Risk:</b> 0/5 (lower means more risk).  Law school is also going to be my riskiest option by far.  If I don't do well in law school, don't get hired, or get fired early, I will have lost a lot of time and money.

<b>Enjoyment:</b> 3/5.  I do have a genuine passion for the law and have enjoyed things like Mock Trial and Moot Court.  Whether this will extend into the law school and corporate law environments remains to be seen.

<b>Replaceability:</b> 5/5 (lower means more replaceable).  I think quite a lot of people could be just as good of a lawyer as me, or better.  But very few people who would take my spot would donate as much of their income.  So I'm very irreplaceable as a potential large scale donor.

<b>Notes:</b> I wouldn't do law unless I got into a Top 10 law school.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Graduate School, Compared</h2>
<b>General Idea:</b> Go to graduate school in political science, psychology, or statistics.  Presumably get a Ph.D., but maybe a masters.  Do valuable research.

<b>Skills:</b> 5/5. I'd develop exceptionally stronger analysis and research skills.  I'd also develop a better grounding in statistics and methods for studying behavioral science.  I'd potentially be able to leverage this to also improve the research of existing EA orgs.

<b>Network:</b> 5/5. Presumably I could connect with strong faculty and maybe alumni who could help me with my career.

<b>CV Points:</b> 5/5.  A Ph.D. is one of the more impressive things you could get.

<b>Direct Impact:</b> 2/5.  It's hard to say.  This depends a lot on what kind of research I could do, how good the research would be, and whether it would affect anything.

<b>Earnings:</b> 0/5. I'd basically live off of $18K a year for a long time.

<b>Information Value:</b> 3/5.  I'd learn more about opportunities in studying behavior and potentially opportunities to apply my field in for-profit and non-profit settings.  I'd also learn if I like academia.  Presumably I'd also learn of other opportunities to do research as well.

<b>Option Value:</b> 1/5 (lower means more restrictive).  I could leave in two years with a masters.  But, for the most part, there's a lot of pressure to stay on the track.

<b>Costs:</b> 3/5 (lower means more expensive).  It at least wouldn't cost me anything, but it's expensive in terms of opportunity cost.

<b>Risk:</b> 2/5 (lower means more risky).  Doing poorly could mean wasting a lot of time and money and not getting anywhere.

<b>Enjoyment:</b> 5/5.  I expect I would like this a lot.  If I weren't worried about impact at all, I would definitely consider this job highly.

<b>Replaceability:</b> 5/5 (lower means more replaceable).  I think my focus on wanting research to be relevant to impact is, unfortunately, quite rare.  If I were replaced, the person who replaces me would probably have less of this focus, care less about achieving meaningful results, and care less about making sure those results are put in practice.

<b>Other:</b> I think I might be able to get a fair amount of these benefits pertaining to research without needing to go to an academic institution, and I don't think this fact is reflected in the above considerations.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Computer Programming, Compared</h2>
<b>General Idea:</b> Get a job in computer programming, earn a fair amount of money (somewhere between $40K and $100K or more) and donate as much of it as I can.

<b>Skills:</b> 3/5.  I'd learn a lot about computer programming, which is pretty useful as a general skill.  I'd also learn about general management things done in businesses.

<b>Network:</b> 3/5.  I don't expect networking options to be out of the ordinary for any career, but I would get the benefit of potentially being in the Bay Area, where a lot of cool EAs / rationalists live, especially ones I don't have much contact with.

<b>CV Points:</b> 2/5.  I don't expect this to be out of the ordinary for any career.

<b>Direct Impact:</b> 1/5.  I suppose software does help people in little ways and makes them more productive.  Depending on which company I work for, this could be larger.  But I don't expect this to add up to nearly as much as the indirect benefits I could achieve through donations.

<b>Earnings:</b> 4/5. Solid earnings, but not as good as law.

<b>Information Value:</b> 4/5. I'd learn if I like programming.  I'd also learn if I like jobs in a corporate, for-profit setting.

<b>Option Value:</b> 5/5 (lower means more restrictive).  It would seem pretty easy to keep options open by taking this route, as I could presumably leave and do something else at any time.  I could also build up savings for more flexibility.

<b>Costs:</b> 4/5 (lower means more expensive).  It's possible I might need to make a down payment at some sort of programming Bootcamp, but this seems relatively inexpensive both money and time-wise compared to other options.

<b>Risk:</b> 4/5 (lower means more risky).  Given my relatively weak background in programming, I run a small risk of not making it very far in this field and wasting some time spent trying to get in.  But I expect that kind of time will be useful skill development (programming training) anyway, so it won't be much loss.

<b>Enjoyment:</b> 4/5.  It's hard to say.  I like programming.  Programming is fun.  But would I like coding other people's projects as part of a team for long periods of time?  I don't know.

<b>Replaceability:</b> 5/5 (lower means more replaceable).  Again, I'd be donating a large portion of my income and that impact is pretty difficult to replace.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Direct EA, Compared</h2>
<b>General Idea:</b> Work directly for an EA organization, like Giving What We Can, 80K Hours, GiveWell, etc.

<b>Skills:</b> 4/5. When I did my internship, the organization focused on a lot of explicit skills development and was a good environment for expanding as a person.

<b>Network:</b> 4/5.  EAs seem more easy to network with than usual, and there would be a fair amount of well-connected ones in any direct work opportunity.

<b>CV Points:</b> 1/5.  I think it would be difficult to explain the value of direct work in a way that looks good on a résumé.

<b>Direct Impact:</b> 5/5.  The whole point of direct work is to get direct impact.

<b>Earnings:</b> 1/5.  Like programming, it could benefit the economy and benefit people who get better products, but I don't expect this to be a large effect.

<b>Information Value:</b> 1/5. I already know a lot about options within EA work, but I suppose there's opportunities to learn about more.

<b>Option Value:</b> 3/5 (lower means more restrictive).  I could presumably leave EA work whenever I wanted, but I think it's a bit more difficult to transition from EA work to other things because of lower salary and worse CV building.

<b>Costs:</b> 3/5 (lower means more costs).  The relevant consideration here is having to take a pretty low salary.

<b>Risk:</b> 5/5 (lower means more risk).  I don't see any risk here.

<b>Enjoyment:</b> 5/5.  I enjoyed my internship a lot and I expect actual work to be the same.

<b>Replaceability:</b> 3/5.  I've had a lot of trouble assessing my replaceability in this area.  I think I do write and research better than the average person they'd hire, but I don't know if that would be true of my hypothetical replacement and, to date, there are some very talented people in the EA movement and applying to EA work.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Market Research, Compared</h2>
<b>General Idea:</b> Go to work at an organization doing statistics for a market research firm.

<b>Skills:</b> 5/5.  I'd learn about market research, potentially taking some information that is relevant to helping EA organizations improve.  A place like Nielsen has very specific on-boarding processes for getting college graduates into the business world and seeing lots of the company.  I'd also learn more research skills.

<b>Network:</b> 2/5. I don't expect networking options to be out of the ordinary for any career.

<b>CV Points:</b> 2/5. I don't expect this to be out of the ordinary for any career.

<b>Direct Impact:</b> 0/5. Again, potentially improving the economy is the relevant factor here.

<b>Earnings:</b> 3/5.  Entering at about $55K is not high, but also nothing to sneeze at.

<b>Information Value:</b> 4/5.  I'd learn more about careers in statistics.  I'd also learn if I like the for-profit 9-to-5 environment.  Also, a place like Nielsen is very good at rotating you around the company.

<b>Option Value:</b> 5/5 (lower means more restrictive).  I could leave at any time with little cost.

<b>Costs:</b> 5/5 (lower means higher costs). There aren't any relevant costs.

<b>Risk:</b> 5/5 (lower means more risk). There aren't any relevant risks.

<b>Enjoyment:</b> 4/5.  I spent a day at Nielsen and it went pretty well.  I have friends in market research who are similar to me in relevant ways and like their work.  I expect to like the work.

<b>Replaceability:</b> 5/5.  Again, because my impact will come from donating salary, I don't expect this impact to be easily replaced.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
I suppose you're all interested to know which opportunity "scores" highest, so here it goes: Market Research (40), Programming (39), Grad School (36), Direct EA (35), Law (25).

Does this mean it's time to just go into Market Research?  Does this mean that law is a terrible idea?

Well, no.  I think it's clearly naïve to tally up the points and declare the winner to be the career with the most points.  Firstly, the top three choices are close enough that they'd be pretty sensitive to small changes in my assessments, and my assessments aren't exactly solid.  Second, I've done nothing to assign relative weights to the criteria -- some criteria clearly should count for more.  And I may have even missed relevant criteria.  Third, my criteria might even be wrong in what I'm emphasizing -- for example, I think the current set of criteria encourages a bit too much risk aversion.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What I Still Need to Know</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is my comparative advantage?  How I can assess that reliably?</li>
<li>How much I would I enjoy corporate law?  What is the environment like?</li>
<li>What is my chance of success (i.e., making partner) in law?  What is my chance of failure (i.e., getting fired)?</li>
<li>How many hours of work is law school?</li>
<li>How much would getting a Ph.D. improve my career opportunities?  What about a masters?  What subject should I get it in?</li>
<li>How much should I be penalizing "delayed" income (i.e., income that only comes after a few years of schooling) according to things like the <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration">haste consideration</a>?</li>
<li>How much would I enjoy computer programming?</li>
<li>What is my chance of success in programming?  What should I expect my personal income trajectory to look like?</li>
<li>Is it actual useful to volunteer for EA organizations in my spare time?  If so, how much useful would it be compared to (1) working longer in a job for more pay or (2) working for EA full-time as a staff member.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Get feedback on this (and other) drafts.</li>
<li>Continue to publish material on careers.</li>
<li>Continue to reach out to relevant people and ask questions.</li>
<li>Start reaching out to populations outside the EA movement, like Denison alumni.</li>
<li>Take the LSAT and GRE.</li>
<li>Try to find relevant experiences that can help me answer some of these questions (like job shadowing, etc.)</li>
<li>Apply to graduate programs, careers in market research, careers in programming, and EA work.</li>
<li>Continue to volunteer for EA orgs.</li>
</ul>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Astonishing!

In my experience, high-fliers are good at their job and dedicated to doing it. In other words they have chosen a career where they are able to develop skills and where they enjoy what they are doing.

A person who told me that had chosen to study Law so that they could earn $150,000 in the first year out of school would make me laugh. There must be a zillion people who could dream up such an idea. I would be interested in the person who could convince me that he was likely to do it!

My advice to you, Peter, is to decide what interests you in life to the extent that you will gladly devote hard work and long hours to achieve it. You may then be successful and lead a fulfilled life. 

Perhaps you will make a lot of money too. But you will find money is of secondary importance and in any case you won't get more than a whiff of it unless you are successful.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You have separate categories for cash earnings and cash costs, but these things are quite fungible, and one doesn't want to be scope-insensitive (0-5) with respect to that.

You say this about market research:

"Replaceability: 5/5. Again, because my impact will come from donating salary, I don’t expect this impact to be easily replaced."

Although you also mention learning benefits for other jobs, if you are evaluating something as EtG it really doesn't make sense to strongly prefer a job that pays $100,000 over a certain period to a job that pays $200,000 with $50,000 in extra costs.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[*comments on law*
&gt; Information Value: 2/5. I’d learn if I want to do law…
The way I think about this metric is, “How highly would I rate taking this job next if my primary aim was to learn about the value of different career paths?” Law scores low in my book because you don’t get to do the actual job for three years, and you have to pay enormous quantities of money. So I’d actually put this one at 0/5.


&gt; Option Value: 0/5 (lower means more restrictive). Law school basically is only profitable if you want to be a lawyer for a long time.
You can also get jobs at think tanks or in law academia. Some think tanks may be decent. I also have the impression that a decent number of successful business people have JDs.

*comments on PhD*
&gt; Skills: 5/5. I’d develop exceptionally stronger analysis and research skills. I’d also develop a better grounding in statistics and methods for studying behavioral science. I’d potentially be able to leverage this to also improve the research of existing EA orgs.
&gt; Network: 5/5. Presumably I could connect with strong faculty and maybe alumni who could help me with my career.
&gt; CV Points: 5/5. A Ph.D. is one of the more impressive things you could get.
Regarding your framework, I think of CV Points, Network, and Skills primarily in terms of their value for giving you more options later. I assess their value both *in general* and *relative to the other career tracks that you’re considering*.  I’m skeptical of how valuable this type of PhD would be for the other career tracks you’re considering, so I’d rate this lower.
Some areas that I see as highly rated in these areas are really top start-up jobs or a job at McKinsey, though I’d like to learn more about this before speaking very confidently.
On this note, I’m not sure how you’re thinking about option value independently of these criteria.

&gt; Information Value: 4/5. I’d learn more about opportunities in studying behavior and potentially opportunities to apply my field in for-profit and non-profit settings. I’d also learn if I like academia. Presumably I’d also learn of other opportunities to do research as well.
A PhD is better than law school in terms of this metric because being a PhD student is more similar to being a prof and you have positive rather than negative earnings. But you don’t get a great idea of whether you’ll be hired into a decent job and there are major risks of getting sucked into a bad PhD, so I’d put this at more like a 2/5 or 3/5.

*comments on computer programming*
&gt; Skills: 3/5. I’d learn a lot about computer programming, which is pretty useful as a general skill. I’d also learn about general management things done in businesses.
I would imagine this is pretty valuable for research and EA orgs. Something to think about.
&gt; Network: 2/5. I don’t expect networking options to be out of the ordinary for any career.
You might want to look into this more closely. My impression is that if you moved to the Bay Area you could meet some pretty impressive people and get a really valuable network.
&gt; Direct Impact: 1/5. I suppose software does help people in little ways and makes them more productive. Depending on which company I work for, this could be larger. But I don’t expect this to add up to nearly as much as the indirect benefits I could achieve through donations.
I can’t really argue for this here, but I think the right kind of work in software could have high returns to productivity, which could be one of the most important metrics for long-run outcomes.
&gt; Information Value: 4/5. I’d learn if I like programming. I’d also learn if I like jobs in a corporate, for-profit setting.
I see this as 5/5 because there is a pretty low cost of finding out whether this is for you, unlike academia.

*comments on EA work*
&gt; Information Value: 1/5. I already know a lot about options within EA work, but I suppose there’s opportunities to learn about more.
I’d say this would be higher if you worked for an org you weren’t familiar with, but otherwise this is fair.

&gt; Replaceability: 2/5. I’ve had a lot of trouble assessing my replaceability in this area. I think I do write and research better than the average person they’d hire, but I don’t know if that would be true of my hypothetical replacement and, to date, there are some very talented people in the EA movement and applying to EA work.
This is addressed somewhat by the fact that if you get the job, then the EA org thinks you’re the best person available for achieving good, so maybe I’d put this up a notch.

*your questions*
&gt; How much would getting a Ph.D. improve my career opportunities? What about a masters? What subject should I get it in?
I feel economics should be on your radar more. Also, I am skeptical of your claim in an earlier post that pysch is probably more valuable than political science. My impression is that people doing political science have a more substantial influence on policy and that people doing psych have relatively little influence at all. Keep an eye out for my forthcoming conversation with Robin Hanson on the value of economics PhDs.
&gt; How much would I enjoy computer programming?
I recommend spending some time doing it.
&gt; Is it actual useful to volunteer for EA organizations in my spare time? If so, how much useful would it be compared to (1) working longer in a job for more pay or (2) working for EA full-time as a staff member.
My first pass judgment is that the thing to do here is similar to what Jeff Kaufman is doing. Do your job, blog about your work and your thoughts so that others can learn about the value of the path. Perform some arm’s length evaluation of EA orgs that you are interested in. I see a lot of returns to specializing in your work.]]></wp:comment_content>

<blockquote><b>Nick:</b> On this note, I’m not sure how you’re thinking about option value independently of these criteria.</blockquote>

I think of option value as how much it sticks me into one pre-defined path before I get the impact.  For non-Law EtG, I start getting the impact (income) immediately and I can quit at any time.  Law school and grad school, not so much.

This is true.  I'll bump it down (4/5 -&gt; 3/5).

<blockquote>You might want to look into this [network value of a Programming job] more closely. My impression is that if you moved to the Bay Area you could meet some pretty impressive people and get a really valuable network.</blockquote>

This is true.  I'll bump up networking here (2/5 -&gt; 3/5).

~

<blockquote>I can’t really argue for this here, but I think the right kind of work in software could have high returns to productivity, which could be one of the most important metrics for long-run outcomes.</blockquote>

This depends a lot on what kind of programming I'd end up doing.  I think this is an important effect, but it's difficult to tease out at the moment.

<blockquote><b>Me:</b> [Programming] Information Value: 4/5. I’d learn if I like programming. I’d also learn if I like jobs in a corporate, for-profit setting.

I'm considering cost separately.

This is true.  I will bump it up a notch (2/5 -&gt; 3/5).  But I still think this is a concern.  Even if I am the best, am I the best by a large enough margin?

<blockquote><b>Nick:</b> I feel economics should be on your radar more.</blockquote>

I don't think I have the aptitude or interest for it.  There's a reason why I switched out of my previous economics major.

<blockquote><b>Nick:</b> Also, I am skeptical of your claim in an earlier post that pysch is probably more valuable than political science. My impression is that people doing political science have a more substantial influence on policy and that people doing psych have relatively little influence at all.</blockquote>

I disagree.  I don't think political scientists have good influence over policy.  Furthermore, I think the benefit of psych research would be to inform the EA movement directly, not to inform policy.

<blockquote><b>Me:</b> How much would I enjoy computer programming?
<b>Nick:</b> I recommend spending some time doing it.</blockquote>

I am.  But not in a full-time, higher-stakes environment.

I think that for a lot of highly skilled work, 1 person doing the job 40 hours per week gets more done than two people working 20 hours per week. This favors doubling down on one thing rather than splitting yourself. This is an intuition I have and I claim I've heard a few other smart people make. It fits my personal experience but I don't have much else to offer in defense of it.]]></wp:comment_content>

Alexei's comment here indicates how much a good programmer can make with 3-4 years of experience: http://lesswrong.com/lw/hd1/maximizing_your_donations_via_a_job/8y6b . Substantially more than the $160k lawyers make 1 year out of law school. 

There are definitely programmers who make millions later in their career. More frequently, there are managers who started as programmers who do the same. And why would you not count entrepreneurs?]]></wp:comment_content>

I don't think just anyone could get more than $160K as a programmer, even four years in.  That number is indeed an outlier from the data that I have, conditional on the skills I bring to the table.

				<title>Doing Important Research on Amazon&#039;s Mechanical Turk?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There seems to be many important questions that need research, from the mundane (say, which of four slogans for 80,000 Hours people like best) to the interesting (say, how to convince people to donate more than they otherwise would).  Unfortunately, it's difficult to collect data in a quick, reliable, and affordable way.  We generally lack access to easily survey-able populations and a lot of research has high barriers to entry for completing (such as needing to enroll in graduate school).

However, since the 2005 creation of <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon's Mechanical Turk</a>, some of this has changed.  Mechanical Turk is a website where anyone can create tasks for people to complete at a certain wage.  These tasks can be anything, from identifying pictures to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-reliability-efficiencyaffordability-of-amazons-mechanical-turk/22994">transcribing interviews</a> to social science research.

Best of all, this is quick and cheap -- for example, you could offer $0.25 to complete a short survey, put $75 in a pot, and get 300 responses within a day or two, and this should be quicker and cheaper than any other option available to you for collecting data.

But could Mechanical Turk actually be useable for answering important questions?  Could running studies on Mechanical Turk be a competitive use of altruistic funds?<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Questions Would We Be Interested in Asking?</h2>
There are a variety of questions we might be interested in that would be appropriate to ask via Mechanical Turk.  I don't believe you could make a longitudinal study, so testing the effects of vegetarian ads on diets in a useful way wouldn't be able to happen.  But less conclusive diet studies could be run in this area.

Additionally, we could test to see how people respond to various marketing materials in EA space.  We could explore how people think about charity and see what would make them more likely to donate and how changes in the marketing affect a willingness to donate.  We could find out which arguments are more compelling.  We could even test various memes against each other and see what people think of them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Is Mechanical Turk a Reliable Source of Data?</h2>
It would only be good to use MTurk if the data you could get is useful.  But is it?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Diversity of the Sample</h4>
The first question we might ask is whether MTurk produces a sample that is sufficiently diverse and representative of the United States.  Unfortunately, this isn't always the case for MTurk.  In <a href="http://www.culturalcognition.net/blog/2013/7/10/fooled-twice-shame-on-who-problems-with-mechanical-turk-stud.html">"Problems With Mechanical Turk Study Samples"</a>, Dan Kahan noted that female populations can be overrepresented (as high as 62%), African Americans are underrepresented (5% in MTurk compared to 12% in the US), and conservatives are very underrepresented (53% liberal / 25% conservative in MTurk vs. 20% liberal and 40% conservative in real life).

MTurkers are <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2012/12/19/how-representative-are-amazon-mechanical-turk-workers/">more likely to vote and vote Obama</a>.  More concerning, Kahan also found respondents lie about their prior exposure to measures and even whether their US citizens.  Additionally, repeated exposure to standard survey questions can bias responses.

But is this really a problem?  First, MTurk samples are still <a href="http://personal.stevens.edu/~ysakamot/creativity/turk%20perspectives.pdf">more diverse and representative</a> than college student samples or other surveys conducted over the internet.  Second, many important questions are about items that we wouldn't expect to be influenced by demographics.  So it's quite possible that MTurk might be the best of all possible sources by enough to make it worth it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Wage Sensitivity</h4>
Do you have to pay more for higher quality data?  Possibly not.  <a href="http://personal.stevens.edu/~ysakamot/creativity/turk%20perspectives.pdf">Buhrmester, Kwang, and Gosling</a> and <a href="http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/03/03/mechanical-turk-to-the-rescue-of-psychology-research/">another analysis</a> both found that even changes between 2 cents and 50 cents didn't affect the quality of data received on psychological studies, but it does buy more participants and at a higher rate of participation (get more participants faster).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Is Mechanical Turk a Competitive Use of Altruistic Funds?</h2>
It depends on the question being asked, how reliable the findings are, and how they'd be put into use.

Even though I don't think MTurk could be used for veg flyers very well, it's the best example I can think of right now: imagine that the current flyer converts 1% of people who read it to consider vegetarianism, but a different flyer might convert 1.05% of people.  This means that every donation to veg ads now has approximately a 1.05x multiplier attached to it, because we can use the better flyer.  If the MTurk study/studies to find this cost $1K, we would break even on this after distributing 100K flyers at 20 cents a flyer.  I don't know how many flyers are given out a year, so that may or may not be impressive, but the numbers are made up anyway.

The bottom line is that studies may have strong compounding effects, which will almost always beat out the relatively linear increase in impact from a donation to something like AMF.  But chances might be small that MTurk will produce something useful.  Likewise, it's possible that there are yet better settings for running these tests (like split testing current materials as they are being distributed, doing longer range and more reliable tracking of impact, etc.).  But MTurk could be an interesting way to supplement existing research in a quick and cheap manner.

I think it's worth thinking about further, even if I wouldn't act on it yet.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Keep in mind that the smaller the effect, the costlier it will be to find that difference with a survey (you need a larger sample to get the same level of certainty).

On the other hand, A/B testing can usually get improvements of more than 5% relative, if software people are to be believed, so your numbers are probably unrealistically low.

On the other other hand, I doubt that studies compound as much as you think. I'd be wary of modelling optimizations as multiplicative (i.e. if optimizations A and B independently double conversion, assuming that combining them will quadruple conversion). It seems to me that there's probably significant overlap in the extra people A converts and the extra people B converts, probably enough to kill multiplicativity.

On the fourth hand, the best way to figure out if these models are correct is to actually do some A/B testing and see how well it works. Mturk is cheap and this seems high VoI. Is EAA or something working on this?]]></wp:comment_content>

This is exactly what I was thinking.  I don't think EAA or anyone is working on this yet.

I was modelling optimizations as multiplicative over future money donated (i.e., an improvement to a flyer makes every flyer purchased after the improvement is made more effective, thereby increasing the impact of those donations).

<blockquote>A/B testing can usually get improvements of more than 5% relative, if software people are to be believed, so your numbers are probably unrealistically low.</blockquote>

I think I also vastly overestimated the amount of money it might take to find results.  $1K would buy a sample size of 2K to 50K responses...]]></wp:comment_content>

<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/comparing-across-my-five-career-categories/">"Comparing Across My Five Career Categories"</a>.</i>

-

I've been having a lot of conversations with various people about career choice.  Because I did not specifically ask most of the people I talked to about whether they wanted to have their thoughts published and because I thought the information was more useful in the aggregate anyway, I've mostly refrained from posting information about <i>individual</i> conversations I've had.  Instead, I've published a lot of aggregated advice in <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/i-now-have-approximately-five-career-categories/">"I Now Have Approximately Five Career Categories"</a>, which is built off of information from 26 different people.

However, I do think there is value in publishing individual conversations, something that is done by <a href="http://www.givewell.org/conversations">GiveWell</a> and <a href="http://www.nickbeckstead.com/conversations">Nick Beckstead</a>.  Therefore, when talking with Satvik Beri about my career choice, we both agreed it would be smart to publish our conversation.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
I'm in my last year of college, looking to figure out what I should do in the future when I graduate.  Broadly, I wanted a job that would do as much as I could toward making the world a better place, which I explain in <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-plan/">"My Careers Plan"</a> and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/i-now-have-approximately-five-career-categories/">"I Now Have Approximately Five Career Categories"</a>.

Satvik Beri is a product manager who is interested in trying to get a large salary, so as to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/sunday-links-4-earning-to-give/">have more money available to donate to charity</a>.  He has experienced very rapid career growth, dramatically increasing his salary over the course of his career.  He's recently decided to reach out to people to talk to them about career choice.

Satvik recently had <a href="http://www.benkuhn.net/satvik">a conversation with Ben Kuhn</a> that was also published.  Satvik also wrote in his blog an essay entitled <a href="http://satvikberi.com/2013/07/17/counterintuitive-career-advice-for-20-somethings/">"Counterintuitive Career Advice for 20-Somethings"</a> where he outlined more general advice.  He also has more advice in <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ifo/what_should_a_college_student_do_to_maximize/9nfp">this comment on LessWrong</a>.

This conversation builds off of that material.  We specifically aimed not to repeat material that was already discussed elsewhere, so I invite you to refer to those three pieces first.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to Pick an Early Career</h2>
Satvik saw my <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/comparing-across-my-five-career-categories/">11-item career comparison framework</a> and suggested that, given my age and inexperience (as just in my last year of undergraduate), I should only focus on three things in my initial career: (a) what skills I would learn, (b) how much aptitude I would have for the job, and (c) how much the job would restrict my options.

The rationale for this, according to Satvik, is that you're usually not preparing for the career you'll have your entire life, but rather preparing to do a series of jumps through positions within your first career or between different careers in order to get progressively better options.  In order to make this happen, you only need those three things -- learning skills and having aptitude in order to be talented enough to make jumps, and having the freedom to make the switch when offered.

Satvik thinks that, applying this framework, I should be wary of grad school and especially wary of law school.  If I were to take Satvik's advice, this would narrow it down things down to computer programming, market research, or direct work in an EA organization.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
But if I wanted to earn to give, how should I decide between computer programming and market research?  When talking with Satvik, I pointed out that I think I would be good at market research but be pretty mediocre at computer programming because I'm still learning and many other programmers have been training for many more years than I have.

Satvik points out that while I might be a mediocre computer programmer <i>among computer programmers</i>, I have the opportunity to be a stellar and amazing computer programmer <i>among market researchers</i>, mainly because... well... not that many market researchers know any programming at all.  Satvik claims that this has the potential to make great opportunities.  For one example, Satvik mentioned that when he was working in finance, he was able to use his knowledge of programming to automate several tasks that people had been doing manually, saving a lot of time and money for his company.  He was then able to leverage these accomplishments for a raise.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to Decide Between Earning to Give and Direct EA Work</h2>
Satvik agrees that not everyone is suited to make an impact via large salaries and thinks it's definitely worthwhile to try and do direct work.  According to Satvik, the only reason he doesn't do direct work is that he feels he wouldn't be nearly as good at it as he feels he is at earning a large income.  So you should do whatever you think best matches your ability -- if you think you're good at earning, you should earn to give; if you think you're good at direct work, you should do direct work.

But how do you know which you're good at?  Satvik suggests that you should try internships in both options and explore your opportunities.  However, one of the best and quickest way to find which you're better suited for is to reach out to leaders of the organizations that you would do direct work for and ask them bluntly whether they'd rather you work directly for them or donate your income.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to Achieve Career Growth</h2>
But how do you make this career growth happen to accomplish these jumps in salary and earnings potential?  Satvik thinks that optimizing what you do <i>within</i> your job is more important than picking a good career in the first place.  Taking a good strategy toward how you spend your time in the career can be the difference between growth or no growth.

Looking at the automation example is a good one -- focus on solving problems in your company and then leverage those accomplishments in your performance reviews.  Accomplish your main action items productively and thoroughly, but then make sure to channel some additional time into connecting with the other people in your office and seeing what they're struggling with.  It's these additional projects where you can distinguish yourselves from others and make strong accomplishments.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>The two steps to doing better within your career or getting a better career are making connections and negotiating.</b>  You should constantly connect with people in your job to see what problems there are and what you can solve.  You should also constantly connect with experts you know outside your career to get advice on how to solve these problems.  Moreover, connecting can let you know about new trends in the market to allow you find high demand areas to switch to in order to get higher salaries.

Negotiation is also important.  According to Satvik, so many people don't negotiate, yet doing so could lead to a noticeable difference in your salary.  Even if the salaries offered to you are capped, you could instead negotiate for more vacation time or a quicker performance review cycle (so your accomplishments are noticed more quickly and you are promoted more quickly).  Perhaps you might even be able to negotiate for better donation matching?  Definitely do some research in advance to figure out what you can get and what you can't.  It also helps to set yourself up to be in a good situation for negotiation by, for example, having multiple offers on the table that you can play against each other.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My Next Steps</h2>
Based on this conversation, I'm going to do new things going forward:

<ol>
<p><li><b>Study more how to make connections and negotiate.</b>  Satvik points out that there really aren't that many good online materials on this; instead most of the good content is in books.  He has provided a reading list.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Put more content online about making connections and negotiating.</b>  Based off the previous point, I intend to blog through some of these readings and post summaries online, to increase accessibility to these materials.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Look more seriously at careers in market research.</b>  Satvik thinks this could be my best contender among my career choices.  Additionally, looking at more opportunities within this sphere could increase my ability to negotiate.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Make more connections.</b> I'll spend more time intentionally trying to catch up with friends and make sure my connections stay strong.</li></p>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh, hi there.  I didn't see you.  Come on in.  The blog is back up and running.  Oh, that dust you see there?  I'll have it cleaned off in just a little bit.  But, no, it's ok.  Come on in and make yourself at home.

Me?  You want to know about me?  Well, ok.  Yes, the blog did take a little bit of a break as you may have noticed.  But I've been doing important things, don't you worry.  Just last Saturday I took the LSAT (exam for law school admission) and the Saturday before that I took the GRE (exam for grad school admission) and I had to study for those exams rather than write for this blog.  I even sent in a job application.  What can I say?  I'm keeping my options open.

...I've also been doing a lot of work for my classes -- it was midterm week.  But everything is accomplished now and I should have some time to return to the blog and write some cool things for you.

Stay tuned.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions-august-edition/">"New Years Resolutions: August Edition"</a></i>

Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-have-i-been-doing/">huge amount of business</a> prevented me from spending the time that is necessary to do a monthly review.  It even got pretty bad -- during the first six days of October, I didn't track anything because I hadn't set up something new for the month.  But everything is good to go from this point and now I look forward to telling you about it.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Did August Go?</h2>
<b>Context:</b> The majority of August was spent at my <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> internship (1-21 Aug) and the remainder was spent at home.  While I was at my internship I focused on working, whereas while I was home, I focused on my friends and family.

<b>Points:</b> My goal was to score 19840 "daypoints" over the month according to my <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/resolutions-update-june-edition/">scoring system</a>.  Instead, I earned 17882.5 points (90.1%), which means <b>the month was a partial failure.</b>

<b>Pomodoros:</b> This month I tried to enhance my productivity by specifically tracking the number of Pomodoros completed.  I ended up doing an average of 4.77 pomodoros a day.  However, this isn't a very good system because I often do work where tracking with Pomodoros is inappropriate (e.g., time spent in meetings).

<b>Time on task:</b> This month I spent an average of 9.93 hours a day working (a 69.51 hour work week).  This was an average of 10.87 hours (76 hour week) during my internship and an average of 7.72 hours after my internship (54 hour week).  Note that work includes everything I do that's not sleep, reading, eating, exercising, showering, getting dressed, hanging out with friends/family, video games, spacing out, watching TV, and other commonsense things.

<b>Time with friends/family:</b> I spent an average of 4.34 hours a day with friends/family (3.51/day during internship and 6.28/day after internship).

<b>Exercise:</b> I spent an average of 124 minutes a day doing exercise -- a mix of bodyweight exercises, running, and biking.  This was helped a lot by the fact that I commuted by bike during my internship.

<b>Oversleep:</b> I went back to sleep after my alarm went off the first time 22 out of the 31 days (71% of the time).  This is something I need to work on.

<b>Diet:</b> I met my goal of drinking 5 cups of water 100% of the time, 5 cups of milk 87% of the time, and eating broccoli 26% of the time.  I ate sweets 28 times and had a fried food once.  I did not track my protein bar goal because I could not find suitable protein bars in England.

<b>Temperance:</b> I never exceeded my coffee or alcohol allowance.

<b>Cleanliness:</b> I met all of my cleanliness goals 97% of the time.

<b>Order:</b> I made my bed 97% of the time, processed everything necessary 90% of the time, and kept my room clean 80% of the time.

<b>Silence and Humility:</b> I felt that there were only three times each when I said something that shouldn't have been said or overstated a claim.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Was New for September?</h2>
I threw out the goal of tracking Pomodoros because I didn't like it.  I also stopped tracking oversleeps and stopped tracking caffeine/alcohol.

I changed my diet goal to match <a href="http://www.chooseveg.com/foodplate">the vegetarian foodplate</a>, looking to achieve a daily 5 servings of grains, 4 servings of vegetables, and 2 servings of fruit.  I also aimed for 5 cups of water and 4 cups of milk.

Lastly, I added combing my hair and washing my hands to the hygiene goals.

Overall, it was pretty much the same.  I think I'm getting to a system I like.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Did September Go?</h2>
<b>Context:</b> I spent all of September at Denison University.

<b>Points:</b> My goal was to get 19200 daypoints.  I got 18057.5 (94%), which again <b>makes the month a partial failure</b>, though I did do better than last month at an equally difficult goal -- improvement.

<b>Time on task:</b> This month I worked an average of 11.6 hours a day, making for an 81.5 hour workweek.

<b>Time with friends/family:</b> I spent an average of 2.7 hours a day with friends/family.

<b>Exercise:</b> I spent an average of 36 minutes a day exercising.  This exceeds my goal of 30 minutes, but is lower than my time in England because I'm no longer commuting by bike.

<b>Diet:</b> I drank an average of 4.23/5 cups of water, 3.67/4 cups of milk, 1.97/2 servings of fruit, 4.2/5 servings of grains, and 3.1/4 servings of vegetables.  This is pretty good stuff.

<b>Cleanliness:</b> I met my cleanliness goals 80% of the time.  This is a backslide here.

<b>Order:</b> I kept my room clean 97% of the time, made my bed 93% of the time, fully processed my inbox 93% of the time, and updated my logs 80% of the time.

<b>Silence/Humility:</b> At no point during the month do I feel like I said something that shouldn't be said or overstated a claim.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What's New for October?</h2>
The only thing I tweaked was that for diet and sleep, I'm now doing things slightly differently -- looking at things during the day and asking "did this go to plan?" and scoring points if it did.  I have a more detailed diet I'm following now which I'll write about soon.  Everything else is the same.

Starting on 7 Oct, I want to get 11400 points for the rest of the month.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/comparing-across-my-five-career-categories/">"Comparing Across My Five Career Categories"</a>, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-conversation-with-satvik-beri/">"My Conversation with Satvik Beri"</a>, and 80,000 Hours's <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/172-interview-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell">"Interview with Holden Karnofsky"</a>.</i>

I've been having a lot of conversations with various people about career choice, however I frequently have not posted information about <i>individual</i> conversations, choosing instead to publish information in the aggregate, such as <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/i-now-have-approximately-five-career-categories/">"I Now Have Approximately Five Career Categories"</a>, which is built off of information from 26 different people.

One conversation I did have that I chose to publish was a quick email exchange with Holden Karnofsky, a co-founder and co-Executive Director of <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, a non-profit that aims to find "outstanding giving opportunities and publishing the full details of our analysis to help donors decide where to give".  Holden asked me to reproduce the email exchange in full rather than summarize it, so I will do so, and then offer my commentary.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Email I Sent</h2>
<i>I sent the following to info@givewell.org.</i>

Hi,

This is probably not the best place to email with this inquiry, but I couldn't figure out where else to email.  I personally identify strongly with GiveWell's message of effective altruism and their particular approach.  Furthermore, I'm very interested in using my career to help GiveWell (or, rather, make the world a better place generally).

I'm a Senior in college now and I'm looking into careers and I've started to wonder whether I would do best to try and get a large salary so as to have a lot of money to donate to top charities or do best by trying to find a job at GiveWell (or a similar organization).

I imagine the answer depends on specifics about me that you wouldn't know, but if you have any advice or can point me in the right direction to answering this question, that would be wonderful.  However, there's also no reason to refer me to 80,000 Hours -- I've already talked with extensively (they actually suggested I send you this message).

Feel free to ignore this email if you're too busy addressing more important inquiries.

Best,
Peter Hurford

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Holden's Response</h2>
<i>The following is verbatim what Holden wrote back to me.</i>

Hi Peter,

I looked at a couple of blog posts you wrote on the subject. Here are some off-the-cuff, informal thoughts...

It seems to me that you're putting too much emphasis on "where am I trying to end up 20 years from now?" as opposed to "Where can I go to make the most of my next year or two?" I think if you get an outstanding opportunity to go outside your comfort zone, try something cool, make some good contacts, etc. you should take it regardless of whether it's a prerequisite to a particular long-term career. With that in mind, I would probably suggest looking for job opportunities in all of your interest areas - and potentially more - and taking the opportunity that seems like a good way to spend a year or two. A "gap year" consisting of e.g. traveling or staying in a very different country could also be worthwhile, etc.

Given the large number of options you're considering and the high degree of uncertainty you have, I think option value should get disproportionate weight. I think law school looks particularly problematic on this dimension - 3 years that will teach you relatively little and benefit you relatively little unless law turns out to be the right answer, something that might be easier resolved by process of elimination than by trying law school anyway.

I would, at least early on, weight enjoyment and aptitude very highly relative to the other stuff, and weight the more direct-impact-measures lower. If you can climb to the "top of the pile" of any field, you can have a lot of impact in ways that are hard to predict, but it's hard to get to the "top of the pile" if you aren't intrinsically interested. I don't know of a lot of cases of people who make huge amounts of money doing something that they're not all that intrinsically interested in, for example. Also, I think you'll learn more about yourself by prioritizing enjoyment and aptitude early on, and learning about yourself is key for getting on a good track eventually.

I think you might be underrating the impact potential of academics. If you can become a successful academic, you'll have a lot of freedom plus the network and credibility that your position provides. If you can find an idea that isn't getting attention from anyone else, and that's important in humanitarian terms, I think your impact can be substantial. It's true that most academics don't go this route, and becoming a successful academic is hard.

One frame that I find somewhat helpful for this kind of decision is to think about your role in the EA movement. If you can give away $5 million in the course of your life, that increases the "funding available to the EA movement" by some percentage (my guess/hope is that it's well under 1%). If you work directly on EA, you increase the human capital of the movement by a certain amount (this is harder to estimate and depends on how you see yourself compared to other people in the movement). I have a general intuition that over the long run, EAs are going to be disproportionately well funded and will be more bottlenecked by human than financial capital (this doesn't mean the best thing to do is work directly on EA activities, but it would argue against earning to give all else equal, at least if you don't expect to be one of the top earners, which it seems you - Peter - wouldn't under any scenario). Another issue is that building up skills that are more unusual in the EA movement could be helpful. For this reason I have somewhat positive feelings toward market research, because it's a world that most people in the EA movement don't have experience with, and an EA who was really good at it could add value in unpredictable ways. I also have positive feelings toward highly open-ended exploration that could lead somewhere unexpected (along the lines of my first point).

I hope that helps. FYI, I'm very interested in these topics, and we've kicked around the idea of organizing a conference call on the subject; LMK if that's something you'd be interested in.

Best,
Holden

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Commentary</h2>
I don't think there's that much to say in response, because I find the comments to be largely reasonable and agreeable.  I do think that I was overthinking things in the beginning and making it a bit too long-term, but I think I've corrected that for the most part.  Overall, Holden's email makes me feel more confident about doing something like market research or programming first, assessing things after a year or so, and then continue on or re-orient toward a different earning-to-give career, direct work, or grad school.

I definitely agree with what Holden says about option value and think I should be wary of tying myself down for too long at first.  Holden seems to have a fair amount of agreement with <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-conversation-with-satvik-beri/">what Satvik and I talked about earlier</a>. [<b>Update:</b> Holden emailed me and told me that he is "largely in agreement" with Satvik, though he can't speak to the part on negotiation.]

I think I have underestimated the impact of grad school in terms of the influence you could get for holding a PhD.  But I'm not confident about the size of this effect, how strong credentials you need to be in order to have influence, or what you can accomplish with that influence.

Additionally, something I haven't thought much about is the "spillover" direct effects of holding a job on the effective altruist movement.  Not only would something like programming or market research give me a salary; it would give me skills that I could apply directly to program or understand markets, etc.  The point Holden makes about market research being valuable because it's unusual is interesting.

Lastly, I found what Holden had to say about the future of funding for the Effective Altruist movement intriguing.  I'm not sure if this is true or not in light of what Jeff Kaufman has said about <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/money-vs-talent-ratios">needing to be about 100 earn-to-givers for every direct worker</a> at the current rate of funding gaps discovered.  But perhaps GiveWell's <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2012/06/28/givewell-and-good-ventures/">partnership with Good Ventures</a> could be indicative of a lot more money flowing in soon?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Should you "earn to give" or do direct work? <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hjn/earning_to_give_vs_altruistic_career_choice/">Here's one perspective.</a>  Notably, the best people in direct work probably can accomplish a lot of good -- <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/69-how-good-are-the-best">the best 10% can do about 8x as well as the bottom 10%</a>.

Wondering whether you'd be the type of person suited for direct work?  See <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/173-looking-for-a-seriously-high-impact-job-using-your-analytical-skills">Holden Karnofsky talk about who would fit well at GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/ia0/should_you_work_at_80000_hours/">Ben Todd talk about who would fit well at 80,000 Hours</a>, or <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/17-high-impact-interview-1-existential-risk-research-at-siai">Luke talk about who should work for MIRI</a>.

If you think computer programming is the way to go and are only missing the "how to make it happen" step, here's <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/di2/advice_on_getting_a_software_job/">"Advice on Getting a Software Job"</a>, <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hd1/maximizing_your_donations_via_a_job/">"Maximizing Your Donations via a Job"</a>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBkmLrQQiFaBCmB99FXObD4-8h2qVtJf-9EvanOuvvk/edit?usp=sharing">some more resources</a>.  It would be nice to see this for non-programming jobs.

Regardless of what job you try and land, though, <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">don't forget salary negotiation</a>.

Also don't forget to consider academics.  Here's <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/140-how-to-make-a-difference-in-research-an-interview-with-nick-bostrom">Nick Bostrom on how to make a difference as an academic</a>.

				<title>Interview With Jon Behar</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/interview-with-jon-behar/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Like both Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld of GiveWell, Jon Behar left a lucrative job at a hedge fund to create a startup called <a href="http://www.apaththatsclear.com/">"A Path That’s Clear"</a>. Here, he runs “Giving Games” which engage people around the world in discussions about effective giving.

Rob Wiblin and I sat down to interview Jon Behar and learn more about his career choices and what it’s like to leave your job to pursue dreams of running effective altruist projects. Jon’s main points were:

<ul>
<li>It can be worthwhile to take some time off to think about things if you no longer are enjoying your job.</li>
<li>Working on something that you think is important can make you more motivated and more productive.</li>
<li>When starting an effective altruist project, it could be important to consider how you could partner with an existing organization rather than proliferate the large amount of EA orgs that exist.</li>
<li>The best way to get into a career in any field is to find people who are already in that field and ask them for advice, even if you don’t know them. You’ll be surprised by the number of people who agree to speak with you.</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>How did you get involved with “A Path That’s Clear”? What lead you to decide to put a lot of time into it?</b>

I got interested in effective giving through <a href="http://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a>. I used to work at a hedge fund with GiveWell’s co-founders and that’s how I learned about the organization and got interested in effective giving.

At the end of 2010, I left the hedge fund to take time off, try something new, and find a new direction in life, because I had been getting burned out and running out of passion for the work in finance. I moved to San Francisco and had a lot of free time to think about things.

One of the questions I kept thinking about was why people don’t give to more effective charities. People respond to GiveWell by saying “Oh, that sounds great, but I give to Charity ABC for XYZ reason” and presumably impact isn’t one of the criteria that matter to them. GiveWell can close an information gap, but we need to know how to address people’s beliefs that lead them to actually use that information to give more effectively.

I saw Giving Games as a way to learn more about why people don’t yet give effectively and how to get them to do so. Once I realized how flexible and powerful the model was, I saw it as something I wanted to pursue and invest my time and effort. This was made easier by the fact that I wasn’t working at the time and was basically just sitting around between jobs.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Do you intend to make a living out of this?</b>

Yes, I’d like to. I think that’s feasible by running a Giving Games program for a larger organization. There’s also speaking opportunities which I haven’t done yet, but are starting to line up now – go to a school, run a Giving Game, do a Q&A, and engage with the students that way.

I’d like to make a package where anyone could run their own Giving Game, but I want to make it freely available so as to not create barriers for encouraging effective giving. However, I’d be open to charging a fee for my appearances and make a living that way.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Did you compare this opportunity with other opportunities that might be high impact, or did you just pick this option and run with it?</b>

I did some thinking about other options. I had considered going back into the finance world and “earn to give”, but the more I thought about the future of A Path That’s Clear, the more confident I became that this was really the highest leverage thing I could do and something I thought I would enjoy more.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Has that turned out to be the case? Has your passion made this job a lot more easier and successful?</b>

I think so. It feels good to be working on something that I feel is important and I think it’s really helped me connect with a lot of other people who are passionate about good giving. I think I am a lot happier and more productive than I would be in a more traditional job.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Have you thought about starting a company and hiring employees to run these Giving Games?</b>

Where I’ve basically landed I was going to, if possible, avoid building an organization from the ground up. I think a better model is to find existing organizations who like the idea and have the desire and resources to scale it and basically get one or several of them to absorb the idea so I don’t have to go through the trouble of building the organization and team from scratch which could be incredibly time consuming. Instead, we hope to develop our relationship further with <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">The Life You Can Save</a> and partner with them to run the programs using their resources and brand.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>You wouldn’t mind having your idea taken over, so to speak?</b>

Not at all. I think there already is an issue of a proliferation of brands in non-profits in general and in EA space, so I don’t want to clutter it any further. Giving Games are basically just an idea that is hopefully clever and anyone can do it and run with it once they hear the idea. There’s no sense of intellectual property and I want people to take the idea and implement it and experiment with it. I don’t by any means think I’ve found the perfect model – it still needs to be refined. The more people try new things and share information, the faster we’ll all be implementing better processes.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Can other people get involved in “A Path That’s Clear”? If so, how?</b>

They can email info@apaththatsclear.com or or use the <a href="http://www.apaththatsclear.com/contact-us.html">contact us form</a> on our website. We love to get inquiries and really want to facilitate and get people involved as much as involved. We’re eager to talk to folks and get people as involved as we can.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>To wrap up, what advice would you give to someone who is in the early stages of their career passionate about fighting global poverty?</b>

I guess the general advice would be to do a lot of networking and a lot of cold calling. If you have an inkling of a direction you want to go in, find the people who are operating in that field and reach out to them. I’ve been really pleasantly surprised by how well that’s worked out for me and how people have been willing to share their time and thoughts with me (and like-minded people). If you hear “no” a few times, it’s not a big deal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've had some very strange swings in my personal opinion on "fair trade" throughout my life.  At first, I thought it was a silly concept for reasons I no longer recall.  But then I read Peter Singer's take on it, who suggested that it basically is just the consumer <a href="http://www.utilitarianism.net/singer/by/200604--.htm">being willing to pay a little extra</a> in order to ensure that the farmers have a better quality of life and the idea of fair trade made sense to me and I wanted to participate.  But then I stopped being sure that <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2007/10/is_it_fair">fair trade actually was substantially improving the quality of life of farmers</a>.  And I realized that if the extra price is essentially a donation to improve the quality of life of farmers, shouldn't <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/personal-consumption-changes-as-charity">I be concerned about how that donation could go further?</a> (<a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/the-make-food-organic-charity">See also</a>.)  Now I avoid buying fair trade things, but <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/donations-report">personally donate</a> the difference between a free trade and fair trade good <a href="http://www.givewell.org">to the best non-profits I can find</a>.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/opinion/overpopulation-is-not-the-problem.html?_r=2&">Overpopulation is not a problem</a> because innovation continues to increase the carrying capacity of Earth.  With our pre-agriculture technology, we probably could only have sustained a few million humans at most.  Reminds me of how, if everyone lived in a New York City level population density, <a href="http://static.persquaremile.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/the-worlds-population-concentrated.png">we could fit the entire world population in Texas</a>.  Also, that thing with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2013/05/population-map.jpg">people living inside or outside this circle</a>.<!--more-->

<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-admin/post-new.php">Julia Wise tells about living on the amount of food that food stamps could buy</a>, which is $200 for a single person, and actually finds it pretty easy.  She even gives tips.  This is something I've thought about a fair amount -- while I think the struggles of the US lower class are important and difficult and shouldn't be trivialized, after reading a significant amount of <a href="www.mrmoneymustache.com">Mr. Money Mustache</a>, I've become surprised at people finding living at $20K per year difficult.  After all, I personally only spend like, maybe $115 <i>tops</i> per month on food.  But I don't really know much about the harsh realities of being poor, so I'm probably just speaking from ignorance here.

Cal Newport says <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2007/12/03/monday-master-class-dont-plan-your-day-with-a-to-do-list/">you shouldn't use a to-do list</a>.  Well, actually, that's just a sensationalist title for a more nuanced point -- you should use a to-do list, but block out time in your schedule for each task based on your estimate of how long the task will take.  I've gone back and forth on whether I like this "timeboxing" technique.  Right now, I'm not doing it, but this article has convinced me to try doing it again.

The US might save lives with military strikes, but are these strikes cost-effective?  Could the US do better by putting the same amount of money into, say, <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com">anti-malaria bednets</a>?  Despite arguments that the military is wasteful, <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/30/military-strikes-are-an-extremely-cheap-way-to-help-foreigners/">the answer seems unclear</a>.

Key ones: understand public opinion and how it can be changed, set achievable goals, be credible, don't demonize people, present solutions instead of problems, and be ready for confrontation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-utilitarianism/">"What is Utilitarianism?"</a>.</i>

I've <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-utilitarianism/">talked about what utilitarianism is</a> and why you might like it.  But what would it look like in practice, in the real world?  A few people have been suggesting that in order for utilitarianism to actually work we have to be utility calculating robots with no desire except to maximize utility in every situation.

However, there's are two big problems with that: first, you're an error-prone human, not a perfect utilitarian robot, so you're prone to make mistakes and therefore accidentally cause things to be worse.  Second, you're a human with normal human psychology, not a perfect utility robot, so you're prone to care about things other than working a 120 hour work week solely dedicated to, say, ending malaria.

So what gives?  Is utilitarianism over?  Doomed to be something nice but impractical?  No.  Instead, you should take your human nature into account and do the best you can.  <b>In fact, doing the best you can instead of trying to be a perfect utilitarian actually better maximizes utility</b>, because if you try to be a perfect utilitarian robot, you'll fail, and the consequences of failure will be worse than if you tried hard.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Two-Level Utilitarianism</h2>
R. M. Hare, in writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Thinking-Levels-Methods-Point/dp/0198246609"><b>Moral Thinking: It's Levels, It's Methods, It's Point</b></a> comes up with two different levels upon which we can think about ethics -- the intuitive and the critical.

At the <b>intuitive level</b> (which Hare affectionally personifies as the "prole"), we think of ethics in terms of what is practical and workable for the every day, where we face a flurry of decisions.  Here, we'll have to rely on basically being automatic with our existing desires, and just do what tends to come naturally.  On the intuitive level, we operate on habit and attitudes with little thinking.  For example, I made an intuitive-level decision to write this blog post, and I have made an intuitive-level decision to watch some television after finishing and then go to bed.  At no point on the intuitive level do I think about whether what I am doing is maximizing utility; instead, I just do it.

At the <b>critical level</b> (which Hare affectionally personifies as the "Archangel"), we think of ethics in full, deliberate reflection.  We reflect upon our current habits, desires, intuitions, attitudes, and plans and ask if they are truly maximizing utility.  For example, I might notice that while I plan on watching television and going bed, I could perhaps make the world an even better place if I instead put an extra hour instead into making this essay more compelling, or tried to convince a friend to donate money, or <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">made some money on Mechanical Turk</a> and donated it <a href="http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">some place I could be confident it would do good work</a>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
People who think we should calculate utility make it sound like we should operate on the critical level all the time, but this is impossible.  Instead, I try to operate on the critical level and reflect as much as I can, but I'll still be spending much of my life on the intuitive level.  Upon reflection, I've decided to stick with my television-and-sleep plan because I just want to relax and have more energy to put into tomorrow, and I'm skeptical that I'll make enough money from Mechanical Turk anyway.

If I focused all my energy into doing the best I can, I run the risk of burning out, and then I won't accomplish anything worthwhile.    If I focused all my energy into planning 100% of the time and never relied on automatic behavior, I'd go insane from making too many unimportant decisions.  I do need to take some breaks, and that's ok.  I do need to act on impulse sometimes, and that's ok.  In fact, both of these things are more than ok, but actually <i>the optimal thing to do</i>.

(All this being said, however, I'd offer two caveats: first, I think the average person would benefit from spending much more time on the critical level.  Second, I think that people tend to take more breaks than they actually need.  So I'd actually suggest that most people should act more overtly utilitarian than they currently do, though it would be bad to try to be a perfect utilitarian.)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Rule Utilitarianism</h2>
But how can we be prepared to operate at the intuitive level?  The answer comes from the idea of a <i>heuristic</i>, which is a convenient rule-of-thumb that is easy to follow, and usually right.  Heuristics for utilitarianism come in the form of the next part of our toolkit; <i>rule utilitarianism</i>.  Rule utilitarianism says that what you should do is that which follows a set of rules, where the rules are whatever set of rules best maximizes utility.

"Don't lie" is a pretty good rule.  Generally, people don't like being lied to, and lies deliberately make it harder for them to operate on accurate information, thus making it harder for them to be successful.  And if they find out about your lie, even more bad things will happen.  Thus, "don't lie" becomes a great example of a rule that should be adopted for use on the intuitive-level.  Thus, when I'm working day-to-day, I'll just remember never to lie to people; in fact, I won't even want to.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
However, these rules shouldn't be taken as absolute; there certainly are some obscure scenarios in which lying would be a good thing.  The classic example is one in which you come across someone you know who wants to kill your brother, and then asks you to tell him where your brother is.  Even if you know where your brother currently is, you should lie and either give a fake location or say you don't know -- you can't risk your brother's life merely for the sake of telling the truth!  This kind of operation requires a quick kick up to the critical level, but should be fine.  Indeed, if you are concerned, you could modify your intuitive-level rule to be "don't lie, except in the case of murderers".

On the other hand, you still want to take your intuitive-level rules seriously and break them only seldolmly and in the most bizarre of scenarios.  You can't just break the rule whenever it appears to be a marginally beneficial thing to do, because you're fallible, it's too easy to trick yourself, and there's too much risk from being wrong.

Indeed, most often the rule breaking is left to a duly elected government to do very carefully.  For example, instead of allowing the poor to break the rule of "don't steal" when they are in extreme need and allowing everyone to be a utility-maximizing Robin Hood vigilante, we have the government legally "steal" from everyone in the form of coercive taxation, and then use this money to see to it that the poor are treated without the need to steal for themselves.  We then can make sure there's enough oversight to make sure the government is careful about doing this, and things turn out pretty ok.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Heuristics and Human Rights</h2>
One form of the way these kinds of heuristics play out in the everyday is human rights.  Belief in God nonwithstanding, human rights are super-strong collective agreements about rules that are to not be broken, under nearly any circumstance.  As Scott Alexander, points out writing for <a href="http://www.raikoth.net/consequentialism.html">The Consequentialism FAQ</a>, this can go a bit haywire, and finding a good balance is important.  (Not to mention that the name "human rights" itself seems to diminish "nonhuman animal rights"...)

The problem with rights is that everyone disagrees about which rights people have, and it can just create an irresolvable argument where one person says "Unborn fetuses have a right to life!" and another person says "Woman have a right to control their bodies!" and then we're stuck.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Recognizing these as heuristics allows us a way out.  Alexander gives the example of freedom of travel -- this is generally a good heuristic because we want to be able to go places without restriction, and that makes our lives better -- however, we wouldn't grant this right to little children or prisoners, because that would make things worse.  Wagering into abortion debates, we'd have to jump to the critical level and see what costs and benefits come out of an abortion, and then make our decisions there.

On the other hand, the decision to restrict freedoms is done extra carefully.  For example, it seems like it would be a good idea to restrict the speech of racists, neo-Nazis, etc.  However, we've come to realize over time that we're bad at figuring out who should be silenced, and thus it's better to go with "never deny freedom of speech on the basis of the content of that speech" heuristic and stick with it, no matter what.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
So what does a utilitarian do in every day life?  A utilitarian does not directly calculate utility and desire only utility, because a utilitarian is a fallible human agent with other competing desires and the inability to put 100% of his or her efforts into caclulating utility.  Therefore, the utilitarian agent will rely on indirect utilitarianism in the form of two-level utilitarianism using rules and heuristics to decide what to do, rather than calculate the best action out of all possible actions <b>every time</b>.

Many people see rule utilitarianism, two-level utilitarianism, indirect utilitarianism, etc. and think that all these utilitarianisms are coming in full force and no one is seeking to maximize total well-being anymore.  I want to make it clear that this doesn't mean the "command" to maximize total well-being has been discarded completely.  Instead, it <i>is</i> this decision procedure to ignore utility calculations in these kinds of scenarios that is being done out of a specific desire to maximize total well-being.

It's the other way around -- people want to maximize total well-being, but recognize that they can't do so by just thinking really hard about what will do so every minute of their lives.  Thus, what we are settling on is specific decision procedures that explain how we should implement the goal of total well-being maximization in our daily lives.]]></content:encoded>

<b>What is this?</b>

This is an essay where I explain my opinions on meta-ethics through a guided discussion with a hypothetical inquisitor.  It seemed like a much easier, more efficient, and more fluid format than writing a dozen tinier essays.  The only downside is at 4797 words, it's a bit lengthy...<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Is that really an "FAQ"?  Does anyone frequently ask these questions?</b>

Well, erm... no.  Not really.  Let's call it "<b>F</b>ormatted <b>A</b>nswers to hypothetical <b>Q</b>uestions", then.  People will understand.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>So, you've finally settled a complex philosophical problem that really smart people with <i>actual</i> philosophical credentials have been debating for thousands of years, and now you're going to tell us the answer to everything there is about morality?</b>

Uh... well, when you put it that way.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>It's true that all you've ever done in philosophy was take Philosophy 101, right?  Just that one class?</b>

Yes.  But I swear I'm widely read!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<b>Ok, I'll ask you an easy question first.  What is meta-ethics?</b>

Meta-ethics is a study of philosophy about what we mean when we make moral statements.  Like when someone says "murder is <i>morally wrong</i>" or "you <i>ought not</i> murder people"... meta-ethics is about what they mean by these statements; what these people are asking.  What does it mean to be "morally wrong"?  What does "ought not" mean?  That sort of thing.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Why should I care?</b>

That's not a very nice way to start us off.  Perhaps you shouldn't care.  In fact, asking whether you "should" care is a question that relies on meta-ethics -- what does "should" mean in "why should I care"?  We'll be looking at questions like this and others throughout this FAQ.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Um, I meant is there any practical applications to meta-ethics and I think that's a pretty reasonable question to ask.</b>

Ok, so you've got a point.  Having correct moral judgments is incredibly important and meta-ethics is all about how we can have correct moral judgments, if at all.  But to be honest the entire question has gotten very needlessly confusing, so I don't blame you for skipping it.  Here, I'll try to make it somewhat clear while trying to persuade you of my view.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Cool.  I'll keep reading.  So what does it mean to be "morally wrong"?  What does "ought" mean?</b>

Jumping right to the good bit first, I see.  I like it.

My view is that when someone says something is morally wrong, they are saying that something violates a particular standard or goal they use to evaluate those actions.  Likewise, when someone says you "ought not" do something, they are saying that the action in question violates this particular standard or goal.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>And what standard or goal do they use?</b>

That's just it.  I think people use all sorts of standards or goals and different goals are implied by the conversation, even if they aren't explicitly stated.  Some use "fairness", some are concerned about not harming people in their community, others might use <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-utilitarianism/">utilitarianism</a>.  Yet more might care about what personally disgusts them or what is required by tradition.  There's all sorts of possibilities.

Let's look at a few examples:

[1a]: Young children ought to eat their vitamins.
[2a]: People under the age of 21 ought not to drink alcohol.
[3a]: The “Bishop” chess piece ought be moved diagonally.
[4a]: You ought to keep your elbows off the table.
[5a]: Rich people ought to donate to charity.

These statements appear to be worded similarly, but the goals implied are very different...

[1b]: <i>In order to be healthy,</i> young children ought to eat their vitamins.
[2b]: <i>In order to follow the law,</i> people under the age of 21 ought not to drink alcohol.
[3b]: <i>In order to play a game of Chess,</i> the “Bishop” chess piece ought be moved diagonally.
[4b]: <i>In order to be polite,</i> you ought to keep your elbows off the table.
[5b]: <i>In order to be moral,</i> rich people ought to donate to charity.

My argument is that [1a] and [1b] are the same sentence and likewise for each pair.  Therefore statements like [1a], while we understand them, are technically incomplete and missing the implied rationale.  But it can't be any rationale.  For example, the following statements are not correct...

[1c]: <i>In order to follow the law,</i> young children ought to eat their vitamins.
[2c]: <i>In order to play a game of Chess,</i> people under the age of 21 ought not to drink alcohol.
[3c]: <i>In order to be healthy,</i> the “Bishop” chess piece ought be moved diagonally.

...Only certain goals make sense with certain statements.  [1c] is not the same as what is implied by [1a].

This view of meta-ethics is called "end-relational theory" and is usually attributed to Stephen Finlay and his paper <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~finlay/OughtsandEnds.pdf">"Oughts and Ends"</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Meaning of "Moral"</h2>
<b>How can the same word have multiple, contradictory meanings?  Are there any other words like this?</b>

I'll suggest one.  How about "sound"?  Luke Meulhauser writes <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/5kn/conceptual_analysis_and_moral_theory/">an essay on conceptual analysis</a> where he uses this example:

<blockquote>If a tree falls in the forest, and no one hears it, does it make a sound?

Albert:  "Of course it does.  What kind of silly question is that?  Every time I've listened to a tree fall, it made a sound, so I'll guess that other trees falling also make sounds.  I don't believe the world changes around when I'm not looking."

Barry:  "Wait a minute. If no one hears it, how can it be a sound?"

Albert and Barry are not arguing about facts, but about definitions[. ...T]he first person is speaking as if 'sound' means acoustic vibrations in the air; the second person is speaking as if 'sound' means an auditory experience in a brain.  If you ask "Are there acoustic vibrations?" or "Are there auditory experiences?", the answer is at once obvious. And so the argument is really about the definition of the word 'sound'.</blockquote>

Another example might be the word "desire".  From the same article:

<blockquote>The trouble is that philosophers often take this "what we mean by" question so seriously that thousands of pages of debate concern which definition to use rather than which facts are true and what to anticipate.

In one chapter, Schroeder offers 8 objections to a popular conceptual analysis of 'desire' called the 'action-based theory of desire'. Seven of these objections concern our intuitions about the meaning of the word 'desire', including one which asks us to imagine the existence of alien life forms that have desires about the weather but have no dispositions to act to affect the weather. If our intuitions tell us that such creatures are metaphysically possible, goes the argument, then our concept of 'desire' need not be linked to dispositions to act.</blockquote>

Other examples probably exist too.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>So could any goal be a "moral" one?</b>

Not really.  I hope my examples make it clear that there's a lot more to normativity (what we ought to do) than morality -- there's also rules of a game, rules of health, rules of etiquette, and the rule of law that we can use to evaluate action independently of morality.  Not to mention rules of epistemology, rules of the office, rules of the pool, etc.

I personally think definitions are arrived by social consensus, and like driving on either the left or the right side of the road — it doesn’t matter how we use a word, as long as we all agree to use it the same way.  The way I see people use "morality", I think the clearest concept is talking about evaluating actions based on whether they regard more than just your personal self-interest; rather, taking into account the direct or indirect benefit of others.

So something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Ayn Rand's Objectivism</a> wouldn't count as a "morality" (though you can disagree with me on this and still accept my main points).  But many standards would.  For example, we could imagine these conversations:

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> > "Is it better to be a hero or a coward?"
Me > "That depends.  What do you mean by 'better'?"
Aristotle > "I mean that which best displays the virtues."
Me > "Assuming I know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_virtues">what list of virtues</a> you're talking about, I would say it's better to be a hero."

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a> > "Should I lie?"
Me > "That depends.  What goal are you talking about when you say 'should'"?
Kant > "I'm talking about whether lying would make sense when willed as a universal law."
Me > "I'd say that you shouldn't lie then, because lying would not make sense when willed as a universal law."

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham">Bentham</a> > "Is it wrong to eat meat?"
Me > "That depends.  What do you mean by 'wrong'?"
Bentham > "I mean it would maximize the predominance of pleasure over pain in the world?"
Me > "I'd say that <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-eat-less-meat/">avoiding meat</a> would maximize the predominance of pleasure over pain."

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke">Locke</a> > "Ought there be safeguards to protect our property?"
Me > "That depends.  What goal are you talking about when you say 'ought'?"
Locke > "I'm talking about whether all people would agree they must do this action when forming a government via social contract."
Me > "Given your theory that governments exist, at least in part, to protect property, I'd agree that there ought to be such safeguards."
<p>&nbsp;</p>
...Though this doesn't work well with everyone:

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._L._Mackie">Mackie</a> > "Is it morally obligatory to donate 50% of your income?"
Me > "That depends.  What does it mean for something to be 'morally obligatory'?"
Mackie > "Gee, I don't know.  I don't think the idea of an obligation makes any sense, personally."
Me > "Then I don't think there's an answer to your question, sorry."

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig">Craig</a> > "Is volunteering at a homeless shelter the right thing to do?"
Me > "That depends.  What do you mean by 'the right thing to do'?"
Craig > "Well, I'm talking about what would be endorsed by a just and loving God."
Me > "I think there's a problem because <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/theramintreess-atheism-part-1-incompatibility">such an entity doesn't exist</a>.  Sorry.  However, if it's any consolation, I do think volunteering at a homeless shelter is just and loving."

While this kind of analysis is directly derived from end-relational theory, it is also called <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/5u2/pluralistic_moral_reductionism/">pluralistic moral reductionism</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>But surely some types of morals are better than others, right?  After all, you're the "Everyday Utilitarian".  So why isn't utilitarianism the best?</b>

I agree with you in part.  As you saw, I just suggested that morality based on God is problematic if God doesn't exist, as I think is the case.  However, I think any morality where we have a consistent list of what is and is not acceptable is a valid use of the term.  One actually could even think of creating a consistent list of commands from a fictional or hypothetical God and use that as a morality even if God doesn't actually exist.  In fact, I'd suggest that <a href="">deontology</a> is pretty much just this -- a list of things that cannot be done not based on any particular principles.

There are reasons why I don't like deontology or virtue ethics, but they're reasons about my personal desires and criteria for morals, not reasons related to meta-ethics.  I think we can judge morals according to additional standards (or <i>meta-morals</i>), but these standards are themselves picked based on our own desires.  Moreover, there could be multiple different such meta-morals and the whole thing starts all over again, cascading to infinity, turtles all the way down.

Basically, I do like utilitarianism the best, but it's not for reasons related to meta-ethics.  I'll save that discussion for the "Utilitarianism FAQ".

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can We Have an Ought Simpliciter?</h2>
<b>There's one thing I don't understand.  Imagine that terrorists have rigged my chessboard so that a bomb will level New York City unless I move a pawn five spaces.  If I ought to not move my pawn two spaces in order to satisfy the rules of Chess but I also ought not level New York City, which one wins?  How do I decide between goals?</b>

That's a bit unrealistic, I think.  You sure about this whole terrorist thing?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Bear with me, this is an important point.</b>

Ok, fine.  In Chess, it's true that you ought not move your pawn more than two spaces.  But if the terrorists have hooked up a bomb to the chessboard that will level New York City unless you move your pawn five spaces, perhaps you should ignore the rules of chess on this one.  But all this means is that the don't-destroy-New-York obligation is more important to you than the follow-rules-of-chess obligation.  We could, though perhaps not easily, imagine some weird monster that cares more about chess than NYC and chooses the other way.  Perverse, yes, but only according to our moral standards, not his.

When we say "we ought not level New York City", we're really saying "In order to avoid killing people, we ought not level New York City" or perhaps even "we morally ought not level New York City".  If we insist that "we ought not level New York City" with no goal applied in a floating ought simpliciter form, we should (in order that we analyze meta-ethics correctly) envision some sort of ERROR 404 GOAL NOT FOUND whenever we try to wrap our head around it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Can't we just say that morality is what we're talking about when we say we ought to do something with no goal?</b>

First, this would be needlessly confusing.  However, there's a more important reason -- by declaring some goal to be what we mean by an unspecified ought simpliciter is to give that goal a special status of being more important than other goals <i>from a meta-ethical point of view</i>, which is a privilege that cannot be justified <i>from this meta-ethical view</i>. There just isn’t a meta-ethical basis to declare one goal better than another; goals are only more or less important in the context of desires and/or other goals.

Though, if you're not playing philosopher and instead playing moral advocate, than by all means abuse the persuasion value of an "ought simplicter" and don't bother to explicitly state the goal in question.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What about an "ought all things considered"?</b>

Another consideration similar to ought simpliciter is that of “ought all things considered”.  What we “ought, all things considered, to do” is that which we ought to do when reflecting upon all possible goals. For example, an estranged wife who could get a huge life insurance payout if she kills her husband might understand that she morally ought not poison his coffee even though she pragmatically ought to.  Feeling the tug of both of those two goals what ought, all things considered, she do?”

We're tempted to just say she ought to put morality first and refrain from the poison.  But this is just because morality is more important to us, not because of some meta-ethical rule.  The idea of an “all things considered” ought to do whatever best satisfies <i>all</i> goals.  Why should the moral goal automatically win?

In fact, I think it's impossible to actually consider all goals, because as I mentioned before there are millions of potential goals, many of which are self-contradictory. This won’t work out.  How can we simultaneously satisfy a goal to poison someones coffee and a goal to ensure that coffee remains free from poison?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Linguistics of Goals</h2>
<b>Let's back up a moment.  If moral statements don't make sense without explicit goals, why don't we just say them?</b>

For two reasons:

First, the speaker might just be making use of a rhetorical device.  The speaker presumably wants his or her command to be followed and will try to do so in the most persuasive way.  It just so happens that leaving out the explicit goal and giving a straightforward command is more persuasive.  Likewise, by leaving out the goal in question, the speaker can potentially appeal to multiple goals at once, depending on how the speaker chooses to make inferences.

Second, the person may genuinely not understand that they're communicating based on an explicit goal.  There is a kind of culture of categoricalness that gives prominence to certain standards without also giving people the ability to understand on what authority these standards are based. Etiquette is perhaps the most clear example — why exactly do we care so much about people putting their arms on the table? It’s apparently something we do.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Alright, now here's a stumper.  How would you make sense of the statement: "You ought to be moral".</b>

Did I say two reasons?  I guess I meant three.  When we look at the statement "you ought to be moral", we might notice the goal implied is circular -- "<i>In order that you be moral</i>, you ought to be moral."  Why be moral?  Because morality demands it, of course!

Sure, this might make no sense.  But that's because you're expecting an expression of a fact. I'll let you in on a secret -- not all language is meant to be exchanging facts.  Consider the sentence “I now declare you husband and wife!”, as uttered by a clergywoman during a wedding for which she is officiating. This sentence has a semantic meaning, describing the action taking place. But it also has a separate, declarative meaning — the actual uttering of that sentence creates a legally significant change that makes the couple in question married.

In 1969, John Searle wrote “Speech acts: An essay in the philosophy of language”, where he found five different roles a sentence can play:
<ul>
<li>Descriptive: The sentence describes a state of affairs in the world. ("The man is tall.")</li>
<li>Assertive: The statement commits the speaker to a belief. ("I believe Jesus is the Son of God.")</li>
<li>Directive: The statement seeks to cause the listener to act in a certain way. ("Please hand me the newspaper.")</li>
<li>Expressive: The statement seeks to express the speaker’s feelings. ("Congratulations! You did so well!")</li>
<li>Declarative: The statement directly causes the world to change. ("You are now husband and wife!")</li>
</ul>

Daniel Boisvert's theory of <a href="http://clas-incubator-wp.uncc.edu/dan-boisvert/files/2012/08/Expressive-Assertivism-PPQ.pdf">Expressive Assertivism</a> suggests that many (but not all) moral statements are like this -- they not only assert a moral fact, but also contain expressive and assertive components that show the speaker really cares about a particular moral standard.  Likewise, I think it's also quite plausible that moral statements are directive that differ little from other orders like "shut the front door".

It's important to take a moment here and appreciate how moral statements can be purely a descriptive statement of fact, purely declarative/expressive/assertive, and some combination in between.  This is precisely how you can get some people thinking there are moral facts and some people thinking that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotivism">morality is just about expressing our feelings</a> -- the reality, I suggest, is a hybrid of both.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Moral Motivations and the Ontology of Morality</h2>
<b>But really...  Why ought I be moral?</b>

It depends.  What goal do you have in mind when you say "ought"?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Ok, wise guy.  I see your game.  I suppose I meant "why should I feel motivated to be moral if I don't want to"?</b>

There isn't any particular reason I could give you.  Generally, you'll feel motivated to be moral if you desire it and identify with it.  Most people desire to be a good person according to some kind of definition because of how they were raised as children and brought up in society.  Most people like to make other people happy, even if it's just their friends and family.  And those that are so sociopathic as to despise everyone don't end up having good lives themselves.

But if you're looking for a rock solid argument that you should give <a href="http://www.boldergiving.org/stories.php?story=Boris_Yakubchik">50% of your income</a> to <a href="http://www.givewell.org">the most effective charities</a> or something like that, there's not much I can say.  It <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/should-we-tell-people-that-giving-makes-them-happier/">might make you happier</a>, I guess?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>So morals are just desires then?</b>

Well, no.  Desires are what motivate us to want to be moral, but are different from morals.  For example, it's easy to talk about a moral system that no one wants to follow.  Moral systems are just logical descriptions that exist out there that are true by definition, kind of like mathematics.  It's just true by definition that utilitarians ought to maximize happiness, because that's what it means to be a utilitarian.  Combine that definition with facts about factory farming and all of a sudden it's true that utilitarians ought to be vegans as well.

We can imagine laws of logic that govern systems that don't even exist.  Morals are kind of like that, descriptions of how people would hypothetically act if they had certain goals and were perfectly rational at following them.  We can still evaluate actions based on these morals regardless of what people desire.  Even if you don't care about utilitarianism, you're still a bad utilitarian if you eat meat.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Ok, maybe they're not desires, but aren't they just opinions?  How could you make some sort of objective ethics out of this?</b>

Again, no.  It's a fact that "if you want to be a utilitarian, you ought not to eat meat".  Likewise, it's a fact that "if you want to follow the law, you ought not exceed the speed limit".  These aren't opinions.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>This still sounds awfully contingent and escapable.  But I thought morals were categorical and inescapable for all agents.  What gives?</b>

Even if people don't care to follow morals, that doesn't mean we have to let them get away with it.  Instead, this is usually where we express our moral statements all the more forcefully.  We can apply our moral standards onto others in a non-contingent and inescapable way, regardless of how they think.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Ok, I get what you're saying.  But when I say that "someone ought murder", I feel a really firm conviction and I don't think it's just a matter of a standard that I use arbitrarily.  Morals are morals.  It's not the case that any standard will do.</b>

Right.  But that firm conviction is the "expressive assertivism" we talked about earlier, not a magic force of morality.  Regardless of how you feel, no moral force will zap people into compliance.  Instead, other people might think differently about morality and there's not much you can say to them to get them to change their mind.  Phillipa Foot discusses how this might be okay in her paper <a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Foot-Morality-as-a-System-of-Hypothetical-Imperatives.pdf">"Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives"</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>So am I obligated to do anything?</b>

Yes.  You have legal obligations to follow the laws, have epistemic obligations to believe the truth, have deontological obligations not to lie <i>under any circumstance</i>, have utilitarian obligations to donate as much of your income as you can manage, etc...  You're under millions of potential obligations -- one for each possible standard that can evaluate actions.  Some of these may be nonsensical, like an anti-utilitarian obligation to maximize suffering or an obligation to cook spaghetti for each meal.  But all of these obligations are there, even if they're contradictory.  Chances are you just don't care about most of them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>But I don't have to do these things if I don't want to, right?</b>

Sort of.  You're right that there's no law of physics that forces your compliance against your will.  However, some of these standards you might care about, and feel motivated to do them.  For others, there might be indirect consequences that you care about.  For example, you may not care anything about the law, but you might care about avoiding jail, and therefore feel a legal obligation.

For other standards, you might not care about them or care anything about the consequences that result for not following them.  For these, you don't need my permission to ignore them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>How can I have an obligation if I'm not motivated to follow it?</b>

The answer here lies in what you mean by "obligation".  To me, I'm defining "obligation" as a requirement imposed on you by a standard.  This is normally called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalism_and_externalism">"moral externalism"</a> if you know what that phrase means.  If you don't, it's ok.

If your definition of "obligation" implies you're motivated to follow it, it just means we're using the two words differently and that's ok, because a lot of philosophy is (sadly) like that.  If you decide that obligations must motivate necessarily by definition, then just realize that it actually isn't the case that you have obligations-under-this-other-definition even if you have obligations-under-the-definition-I-was-using.  Either way, it still makes sense to talk about these requirements imposed on you by standards, regardless of what you choose to call them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Moral Realism</h2>
<b>Now I'm confused.  Is this view "moral realist" or "moral anti-realist"?</b>

Those of you who don't know what this means, you can skip this question -- you're not missing much.  For others, I know you'll hate me for saying this, but it depends on what you mean by "moral realist" and "anti-realist".  I agree that when people make moral claims, they might be saying things that are true, which is a very <i>realist</i> claim.  However, I disagree that there is One True Moral Standard.  I agree that you're under moral obligation, but I disagree that these obligations have some sort of compelling force independent of desire.  Depending on who you talk to, this makes me "realist" or "anti-realist".

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<b>How does this view make sense of moral debate?</b>

Have you noticed that when most people argue about a moral issue, they're mostly talking past each other?  Well, this view offers a perfect explanation for how this happens -- people hold two different moral goals, never mention these goals out loud, and therefore never realize that their disagreement is not about a fact, but rather about which goal to apply.  It's easy for someone to say "I think it's wrong for a woman to have an abortion (in order to obey the commands of God)" and another person to say "I think it's right for a woman to have an abortion (in order to preserve the autonomy of the woman)" and not notice that one person is talking about God and the other person is talking about autonomy.

Of course, this doesn't mean that all moral debate has to stop.  Instead, we could talk about whether or not God exists and can give commands worth caring about or whether it makes sense to talk about "autonomy".  But it's also possible that people might just fundamentally value different things and have a legitimate moral impasse.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Okay, so there are some appealing things about your view.  But is it just your crazy view, or do other philosophers support it?</b>

I'd be interested in seeing what some professional philosophers think.  Perhaps it's a little cocky, but I think there's a moderate chance that some philosophers would say they agree with me.  I'd expect Stephen Finlay to agree with it, since it's essentially his theory.  I think what I am saying is not too different from what Peter Singer is saying in <a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Singer-The-Triviality-of-the-Debate-Over-Is-Ought-and-the-Definition-of-Moral.pdf">"The Triviality of the Debate Over Is-Ought and the Definition of 'Moral'"</a>.  Also, this view is pretty similar to <a href="http://richardcarrier.blogspot.com/2011/10/goal-theory-update.html">Richard Carrier's Goal Theory</a>.

And while they're not Ph.D. philosophers, this view is virtually identical to Luke Muelhauser's <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/5u2/pluralistic_moral_reductionism/">Pluralistic Moral Reductionism</a> and not that different from Alonzo Fyfe's <a href="http://desirism.wikia.com/wiki/Desirism">Desirism</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>I'm running out of questions.  Can you quickly summarize all the reasons why I might prefer your view of meta-ethics over a different one?</b>

My view is that when we say we ought to do something, we're really implying some sort of goal, standard, or reason for doing that action, even if we don't say it.  Of these potential goals, there might be many -- some moral, some not.  You should adopt this view because it (a) makes the most sense of all senses of ought, including non-moral ones, (b) explains both the expressive / assertive content of moral statements and the descriptive content of statements better than alternative theories, (c) best makes sense of (the failures of) moral debate, and (d) doesn't unjustifiably make any particular goal superior to all others.

In short, you ought to adopt my view (in order that you hold true beliefs about meta-ethics).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Any acknowledgements?</b>

Yes.  I'd like to acknowledge Stephen Finlay and Daniel Boisvert for laying the foundations of the theory as well as pretty much the entire theory.  I'd also like to  thank Garren Hochstetler over at <a href="http://wordsideasandthings.blogspot.com/">"Words, Ideas, and Things"</a> for first mentioning this idea to me and defending it in a way that persuaded me to change my views.  Lastly, I'd like to thank Alonzo Fyfe, Luke Muelhauser, and Richard Carrier for getting me interested in meta-ethics in the first place.

This is probably a good time to mention that I didn't make up this theory myself -- it's actually 100% the views of other people, put together into one place.

And it can be refined as to "what quantities are likely to be harmless or likely to cause harm?" and "would it be beneficial or harmful in this or that situation?" 

All of morality is about actual benefits and actual harms. The moral person seeks the best possible good for everyone and the least harm. 

All of ethics is about which rules are most likely to achieve the best good for everyone. The ethical person follows the rules. 

The moral person designs and chooses the rules that are most useful toward achieving the best possible good for everyone. It is specifically that "utility" that is the criteria for judging every rule.]]></wp:comment_content>

This won’t work out. How can we simultaneously satisfy a goal to poison someones coffee and a goal to ensure that coffee remains free from poison?"

"First, this would be needlessly confusing. However, there’s a more important reason — by declaring some goal to be what we mean by an unspecified ought simpliciter is to give that goal a special status of being more important than other goals from a meta-ethical point of view, which is a privilege that cannot be justified from this meta-ethical view. There just isn’t a meta-ethical basis to declare one goal better than another; goals are only more or less important in the context of desires and/or other goals."

I think the first paragraph I quoted actually counters the second paragraph, in the sense that the fact that some goals directly contradict each other implies that there needs to be, from a meta-ethical point of view, a way to resolve this conflict.  And the only way to resolve said conflict is to privilege some goal over other goals.

In my view, the meta-ethical basis for privileging the moral goal over other goals is that the moral goal is different from non-moral goals in the sense that it makes claims on all statements and actions.  What I mean by this, is that, to use your example:

"In order to play a game of Chess, the “Bishop” chess piece ought be moved diagonally."

"In order to play a game of Chess" is a non-moral goal.  It makes no claims about things not relating to it.

Thus, "In order to play a game of Chess, people under the age of 21 ought not to drink alcohol." is nonsensical.  It is not even strictly false.  Chess just has nothing to do with whether or not people of a certain age should be allowed to drink.

However, the moral goal can actually be applied to all statements.

So the statement:

"In order to be moral, the “Bishop” chess piece ought be moved diagonally."  actually can have a legitimate context.  It could be true if playing chess at this moment was the moral thing to do, for instance, because it made the players happy and this was moral.  Or it could be false, in the sense that perhaps the players should actually be spending their time volunteering for charity.  In either case, the statement is not nonsensical.

"In order to be moral, people under the age of 21 ought not to drink alcohol."  is also a statement that makes sense.  It could be true or false, but it shows that the moral goal is relevant to everything.  Unlike non-moral goals, the moral goal has a kind of totalitarian aspect in that everything matters to it.  It can be applied to and make sense of any ought statement.

In that sense, because it factors everything into itself, I think the moral goal is the one candidate for an ought simpliciter that actually makes sense.]]></wp:comment_content>

It makes me curious though.  Everything both of you (you and Luke) have mentioned seems to be quite narrow and specific for what seems like a really <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaethics" rel="nofollow">large academic field</a>.  Are there any parts of meta ethics that you feel most EAs should know of that you didn't include here, or do you think that most of the useful bits are really this simple (which would be understandable).

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Everyday Utilitarian,

I am a fellow Utilitarian trying to spread the gospel of utility maximization.  I am also a new graduate student in philosophy, working on a proof of Hedonism.  I am probably years from completing it, although who knows, perhaps by then I'll change my views and become a Natural Rights deontologist or Divine Command Theorist (God forbid).

I liked this post, although I might amend your answer to "What is Metaethics?" slightly by adding that not only is it the study of the semantics of moral statements, but also involves the epistemology and metaphysics of morality as well.  That is, it studies what we mean by ethical statements, but also how we come to know whether they're true or false (if they're truth-apt at all), and also what it is in reality that they depend on.  

These are important because, first with epistemology, we have to answer questions about whether or not our moral intuition is reliable, and with metaphysics, whether moral facts can be the best explanation about what we experience through moral intuition.

Lots of religious people and maybe the majority of Americans (though I sure hope not) think that morality depends upon god, so without god there can be no morality.  We utilitarians (and in my case Hedonic Utilitarians) disagree, as we think the well-being (pleasure and happiness minus pain and suffering) of conscious creatures can ground morality just fine.

I recently began a philosophy blog, mostly focused on metaphysics and ethics, and the majority of posts involve a defense or explanation of my version of utilitarianism and consequentialism.  If you feel like checking it out it's at:

http://philosopherstoner.blogspot.com/

If you enjoy it, perhaps we can provide links to each others' blogs on our own respective blogs.  Obviously since mine is new and has almost no traffic, you have a lot less to gain from this arrangement.  But it's possible that total utility will be maximized anyway ;).

Keep up the good work,

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Morality is the intent to achieve good, and to achieve it for others as well as for ourselves. Ethics is the pursuit of the best rules, those that will most likely achieve the best possible results for everyone.

To see the distinction, consider the Jewish family of Anne Frank hiding in the attic during Nazi occupation. The soldiers knock on the door and ask if there are any Jews. It would be unethical to lie, but it would be immoral not to.

We call something “good” if it meets a real need we have as an individual, a society, or a species. A “moral good” is actually good for us and benefits us in some way. A “moral harm” unnecessarily damages us or diminishes our rights in some way.

Moral judgment considers the evidence of probable benefits and harms to decide a course of action. This judgment is objective to the degree that the harms and benefits are easily observed and compared. But the ultimate consequences of a decision are not always known. Two good and honest individuals may differ as to what course of action will produce the best result.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The goal of achieving the "best possible good for everyone" is the only thing which everyone can agree to. So that should satisfy Locke. And it should also satisfy Kant. The Utilitarians need only consider that the proper use of ethics is to attain what is really good for us and not simply to attain pleasure, since many sources of pleasure are actually bad for us. And some pains, such as childbirth, are good for the species as a whole. The deontologists are continually trying to nail down the rules which empty rhetoric once and for all, but they have to keep pulling up the nails, like when it turns out that slavery was not such a natural right as previously thought. And every Christian who speaks for God claims that God is Good and seeks what is good for us (and Jesus and Paul pretty much went around rewriting God's opinion on what the rules were). 

All ethical systems serve moral good, and every rule is subject to judgment by the criteria of advancing good and reducing harm. Both gay marriage and the 20 week abortion rule will be judged by their benefits and harms.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["Whoa! That’s a stretch. Empathy with suffering is suffering. From that suffering we attempt to alleviate the suffering of someone else as if it were our own. That is a good thing, of course. But empathy is not a happy or pleasurable mental state, but rather something we endure for a better good for both."

Well, the alleviation of the suffering, that is, the happiness that you feel when someone is no longer suffering and you're empathetic towards them, is the happy mental state that we want, as is the happy mental state of the person no longer actually suffering.  Empathy in this way, "double counts".

"And, yes, I almost said so that both may be happier. But the Samaritan could have retained his current happiness by suppressing his empathy, like the priest and the Levite did. In that case we would call him the “Happy Samaritan”, but he would not be the “Good Samaritan”."

I doubt if he was truly empathetic that he would be happier just suppressing his empathy.  The feeling doesn't go away just because you choose to ignore it.   Have you ever heard of the Empathy-Altruism hypothesis in Psychology?

"Indeed. So do we fix this by teaching them “a better way” or by teaching them “a happier way”?"

I argue that both are ultimately the same.  The "happier way" is the one that truly maximizes everyone's happiness.  This is the "best way" so to speak.

"We would like to believe that a “better” way will be a “happier” way in the long run. But it may require considerable suffering and self-sacrifice to make things better. Hey, a fellow could get crucified, for Good’s sake."

And that sacrifice was so that everyone could go to Heaven and experience maximum happiness for all eternity.  Thus, we do often sacrifice lesser happiness for greater happiness.  That's the basis of the whole "Greatest Good for the Greatest Number" notion of Utilitarianism.  It's not just about pleasing the majority, but rather, it's about counting the long term happiness of every individual and valuing it fairly and equally as one and only one in the grand moral calculus.

"Spoiler alert, she puts several bullets in the guy who conned her. In the last scene, she steals another lady’s gold lighter in a restaurant. In “House of Games”, she loses her conscience. Mamet’s “Oleanna” is another very strange morality play movie. It’s like act 1 and act 2 are on two different planets."

I haven't seen the movie, so I can't tell you what I think about it.

"What is the utility of that perspective? To whom is it useful?"

It's useful to all sentient life, because it means we actually value them when we do the moral calculations over what the right action is.  There is a huge difference between being counted and having your happiness weighed, versus not.

"So the subject is any self-aware being, capable of happiness and suffering, in the same or similar fashion as we are. So any animal would be off-limits for food. Eggs and milk should be okay though, because the products are not sentient."

It's more complicated than that.  We have to weigh the relative sentience of each being and in the case of animal food consider whether or not their suffering can be outweighed by the happiness that we get from eating them.  Eggs and milk also tend to cause indirect suffering for the animals that are forced to produce them.  Many serious Utilitarians are Vegan for this very reason.

Here's a good essay on the issue: http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html

"So what do we feed the lions and tigers?"

In a perfect world, there would be some way to synthesize meat without causing suffering, and we'd feed them that.  Unfortunately that technology isn't ready yet, so it's a bit of a moral dilemma.  Perhaps you feed them the least sentient animals (or the least suffering per kg) that you can reasonably sacrifice for the sake of the lions and tigers.  Suffice to say, nature is not set up to be particularly moral.]]></wp:comment_content>

If that means hooking everyone up to drugs, or the experience machine, so be it. This is not a problem with my view. You may think it is, because you think it is objectionable. But you are simply expressing your sentiment of disapproval. You sentiment of disapproval is not a reliable guide to moral truth, in my opinion. It has been warped and molded by evolution and society."

But you too are a product of evolution. And if we perform an empirical test, where the test subjects are hooked up to the pleasure machine until they die, and the control group deals with reality in the usual way, and let it run for a couple of generations. Which will survive: those who used happiness as their primary guide to moral behavior or those who valued survival above happiness?]]></wp:comment_content>

The first thing I don't like about it is that I have to look it up. And I would like to get my moral guidance in English rather than Greek. 

But the fact that it combines "good" with "spirit" brings us back to my remark that "the holy spirit is feeling good about being good and doing good". 

We ought to feel good about loving good for ourselves and others. And perhaps that is the happiness that has true moral utility.]]></wp:comment_content>

A rock has the fewest needs. Living things are animated by innate needs. I don't think we have the option of adding or subtracting innate needs without changing into a different life form. 

But goodness is relevant to the species. What is good for the fish may be different from what is good for humans, especially on Friday nights. 

On the other hand, what is good for the fish and bad for the fish is also knowable through observation. Whether the fish experiences pleasure or not is a matter of speculation. But whether the fish is diseased or dying can be observed. Whether the fish needs water and food can be observed. Whether the fish is harmed by toxic chemicals can be observed. So we can know empirically what is good for the fish and what is bad for the fish.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nick: "How do I know when something that I observe is a benefit or a harm?"

We know by observation that food is good for the starving man, that water is good for the guy in the desert (but not for the guy drowning), that shelter is good in a winter storm, that regular exercise improves health, and that smoking is harmful for most people (I saw an article recently that nicotine may actually be good for Parkinson's disease). 

These and other things are objectively good or bad for us by scientific evidence. 

And they remain objectively good or bad despite how we feel about them. For example, the girl with bulimia may feel her quest for happiness depends more upon her extreme thinness than her nourishment. 

We also may deduce from the basic needs that the ability to secure food, clothing, shelter, and medical care as needed is also a good thing. Therefore education and job training are also good things. And a regulated capitalistic economy is a good thing. 

And I vote for Democrats, because they are more likely to spend money on parks for recreation so that kids get more exercise, and music programs in schools so that kids learn pleasurable activities, etc. 

As we get away from the starving man scenario and move into the political scenario, there is likely to be disputes as to what is good or  bad for us. 

And I suspect you will find a similar problem in clarifying what will objectively and reliably make you happy. 

Nick: "The hedonist is on more objective ground, because we claim that pleasure is good and pain is bad, no matter the source."

And I've supplied many examples now where that criteria leads to bad moral choices. The pleasure from passing a gang initiation, the pleasure from cocaine and heroin, the bulimic's quest for thinness, etc. are all cases where pleasure has lied to us about what is really good for us. Therefore the criteria of pleasure/pain and the quest for "happiness" is not a reliable guide to a moral rule system. 

Nick: "If the quantities are equal, the pleasure that results from going to the opera is no better than the pleasure that results from going to the strip club. There is no subjectivity in this standard."

The example you present is the very definition of subjectivity! One subject experiences the opera as happiness while the other experiences it as suffering. The same may be said for the strip club. And a doctor can probably dose you with the correct quantity of morphine to match the quantity of "happiness" in either experience. 

But every person who is starving will benefit from a plate of beans whether they like beans or not. 

Nick: "What is this "quality of life" that you speak of? How do you measure it?"

At one end of the measuring stick is Hell. At the other end is Heaven. 

A current example close to Hell would be the war in Syria, where the security of your basic needs is continuously in jeopardy and your choices are between fighting/dying and running. 

A current example closer to Heaven would be a man with a steady job in a stable country who enjoys the benefits of meeting all of the real needs of himself and his family. Medical care is accessible and affordable when needed, and so is recreation in parks, tennis courts, etc. 

Nick: "How do you know what is good or bad, or beneficial or harmful?"

We call something "good" if it meets a real need that we have as an individual, a society, or a species. We call something "bad" if it causes unnecessary harm or prevents meeting a real need. 

A necessary harm produces a greater, overriding benefit, like childbirth or vaccinations or a root canal or exercising. An unnecessary harm is any physical or emotional damage that does not produce a greater overriding benefit. 

Nick: "How do you distinguish real needs from desires?"

For basic physical needs there is empirical evidence as to what is necessary to sustain or improve life and what damages us. Anything we can truly live without would be a desire as opposed to a real need. 

We also need a general ability to secure what satisfies these basic needs. That requires basic freedom plus education or training a means of cooperation with others, and so forth. 

To avoid species extinction, we need cooperation to reduce population expansion beyond sustainability, etc.  

Nick: "What if someone else has a different opinion?"

We need a democratic process to resolve differences where the best action or rule is in dispute. This involves research, discussion of alternatives, and a democratic vote to determine a working rule or test action, both of which may be reviewed and revised later by the same process. 

Nick: "You said when needs conflict, you need to find the best good possible."

Right. And nobody knows all the answers to all the possible scenarios in advance. 

For example, two guys in the desert with only enough water for one may have several solutions. If they believe there is the possibility of rescue but the time of rescue is unknown, then the best option would be to share the water until rescue or until one of them dies. Another alternative may be that one will feel compelled to sacrifice himself to improve the chances of the other. 

Both options can be argued as the best possible good for all (knowing that all life ends anyway, a noble sacrifice may not be the worst way to go). 

How do you "happiness" guys resolve this problem?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[DL: "Well yes, but it's because I want those people to be happy that I view depression as bad.  Again, I'm not suggesting you follow the lead of the mental state.  I'm suggesting you create good mental states in people and value that."

Right. We would want to heal her mind first, before her depression results in tragedy. 

But we don't want to create a good mental state in Hitler. We'd prefer that he experience empathy and remorse for the people he enslaved and injured and killed. If he takes a Valium to assuage his guilt then he satisfies his feelings but continues to do harm. 

The mental state is not the objective of correction, but rather the prevention of further harm. 

Did you see David Mamet's "House of Games"? A psychologist is conned, wreaks vengeance, and tells her analyst instructor that she has done something unforgivable. Her instructor, thinking to be helpful, tells her that when you do something unforgivable you must forgive yourself. And that's something that psychology has been criticized for in the past. 

Anyways, the object of morality cannot be just to feel good, but rather to feel good about being good and doing good. 

DL: "What makes one species better than another species?"

It's not a question of being better. It's a question of survival. When the next ice age comes, the vegetarians will become extinct. 

DL: "I would argue that the best moral system should encompass all living creatures, not just one species."

And if a majority of humans decided that we should turn the planet over to the dolphin, you'd go along with species-suicide?]]></wp:comment_content>

But empathy is a good mental state.  So would be love for all humanity.  These things all fall under my broad definition of happiness.  Just because he does evil doesn't mean he doesn't deserve happiness.  How do you know that Hitler wasn't mentally ill and had paranoid delusions that the Jews were evil?  Hitler was the result of a combination of genetics, experiences, and circumstances that created him.  If you really believed the things that he did, you'd probably have acted no different.  Indeed, many people did believe what he did, and tacitly approved of his actions.  Were all these people just evil?  I would argue that there is more to that.  Have you ever heard of the term, the Banality of Evil?  Normal people given the wrong set of beliefs, in the wrong upbringing, and in the wrong circumstances, can do tremendous evil while thinking that they are doing the right thing.

"Did you see David Mamet’s “House of Games”? A psychologist is conned, wreaks vengeance, and tells her analyst instructor that she has done something unforgivable. Her instructor, thinking to be helpful, tells her that when you do something unforgivable you must forgive yourself. And that’s something that psychology has been criticized for in the past."

I suppose you'd also criticize Jesus for forgiving sins then?

"It’s not a question of being better. It’s a question of survival. When the next ice age comes, the vegetarians will become extinct."

I don't see how that follows.  Assuming that the ice age creates a limited resource situation, arable land is better off being used to create plant food than it is to create livestock.

"And if a majority of humans decided that we should turn the planet over to the dolphin, you’d go along with species-suicide?"

That depends entirely on whether or not it would be moral to do so.  I can conceive of a situation where we might invent a super-intelligent A.I. that could solve all the worlds problems, if only we let it take over.  If we could prove that this was the most moral thing to do, then I would say it was correct.

Your still missing the fundamental point here, which is that we need some way to classify the moral value of a species or organism.  The easiest way to do so would be to compare the relative level of sentience.  Humans have by far the most neurons in their brains and are clearly more intelligent and capable of experiencing good and bad mental states.  Other species are less so, but many of them can still experience consciousness to a lesser degree, and that gives them some moral worth, because they can feel and suffer.

Plants on the other hand, despite having needs, do not feel anything.  They lack a mind and therefore are not subjects.  Only subjects that experience things, have moral worth.  Only subjects can value things at all.  A comet that falls into star, doesn't care that it is disintegrating.  It thus has no moral worth.  Things only matter when subjects exist to care about the state of reality.

A plant in Hell would feel nothing and not care.  A human in Hell would care a great deal.  Morality is in many ways, the sum of all cares in the universe.  If no subjects existed, there would be no need for morality.  It is strictly because subjects exist that morality is relevant.]]></wp:comment_content>

Take for example the post-partum depression that causes some new mothers to kill their children or take their own life. It would be better that their mental state be addressed and healed rather than following its lead."

Well yes, but it's because I want those people to be happy that I view depression as bad.  Again, I'm not suggesting you follow the lead of the mental state.  I'm suggesting you create good mental states in people and value that.

"I don’t think you can guarantee Hoffman that the accumulation of happiness in the future would outweigh his fatal injection of happiness. After all, he will endure the pangs of withdrawal and will wish for another hit for a very long time. And he could be hit by a truck tomorrow."

Just because we could be hit by a truck tomorrow, doesn't mean we should never make plans for the future.  We're trying to maximize expected utility, which is based on reasonable predictions of what in the future is probable.

"Moral worth is species relevant. When I had a cat I cared for it because it was of value to me. From the cat’s point of view, I was of moral value to it, because I made sure it got fed and had a fresh litter box.

From the human’s perspective, wildlife has value as a source of beauty, food, comparative behavior, etc. But if it comes down to a final battle between humans and cats, I’ll be fighting on the side of my own species.

The same applies to bacteria. We look at them from a human perspective, appreciating those that aid our digestion, but seeking to destroy those that might uncaringly destroy us."

So you're speciesist then?  What makes one species better than another species?  You're arguing right now that non-human species only have moral worth in relation to how much they benefit us.  That seems, very subjective.

"Actually, there is nothing different about constructing an objectively correct ethical system based upon the best possible good for all plants or all fish or any other living creature. The rules will be different for each species of course."

I would argue that the best moral system should encompass all living creatures, not just one species.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["Where the utilitarians go wrong is use “pleasure” and “pain avoidance” as the goal of ethics. They confuse feeling good with actual goodness."

I think the opposite occurs with non-utilitarians. I think non-utilitarians experience good or pleasant feelings, which is where they get the concept of goodness in the first place, and then they project it onto other things that are in reality neutral. Much like a naive view of color, where one experiences the phenomenal quality of redness and then projects this property onto the apple. But that property is a property of experience, not the apple. The apple has a surface reflectance, for sure, which has a tendency to produce the redness qualia. But the redness qualia in the mind is not a property of the apple. Likewise, intrinsic goodness is not a property of external, mind-independent objects.

"And if everybody’s guide to ethical behavior was simply to do whatever feels good, we’d all be hooked on crack or heroin."

Again, you've attacked this strawman several times already. Doing crack or heroin is NOT conducive to OVERALL happiness/pleasure. It is only conducive, perhaps, to IMMEDIATE pleasure. We utilitarians don't want to sacrifice overall pleasure for immediate pleasure.

"The “future happiness” argument suggests that if we could be hooked for the rest of our lives, that it would then be okay."

I happen to think that whatever produces the greatest overall amount of pleasure and minimum overall amount of pain is right, no matter the source. If that means hooking everyone up to drugs, or the experience machine, so be it. This is not a problem with my view. You may think it is, because you think it is objectionable. But you are simply expressing your sentiment of disapproval. You sentiment of disapproval is not a reliable guide to moral truth, in my opinion. It has been warped and molded by evolution and society.

"Only life is intrinsically good."

Life is intrinsically good? What does that mean? That means we should procreate as much as possible? We should never kill any animals? We should outlaw euthanasia and force people to live healthy at gunpoint? What is intrinsically good about life? You accuse me of being like Colbert. But this is even worse. How did you come to the conclusion that life is intrinsically good? A gut feeling? Not a gut feeling? What is this special moral faculty you have, and how do you know it's reliable? 

"All other goods are relevant to their beneficial or detrimental effect upon the quality of life."

This is an empty statement, without a definition of "quality". How do you define or determine what this quality is? Gut feelings again?

"Because the pursuit of happiness leads to a lot of unhappiness, it makes more sense to pursue goodness itself, and decide to feel happy about achieving it."

This is not even an argument against hedonistic utilitarianism. You're simply saying that if we consciously adopt happiness as a goal, it will NOT maximize happiness. That's not even a moral claim, that's an empirical one. And perhaps it's true, I don't know. IF it is true, then I agree, we should consciously adopt whatever end DOES maximize happiness.

Again, what is this 'goodness' that you think we should pursue, and how do you know it actually is good?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nick: "But the redness qualia in the mind is not a property of the apple. Likewise, intrinsic goodness is not a property of external, mind-independent objects."

There is a real property of the apple, independent of any mind, which most of us can see, and which we have chosen to call the color "red". The observing and naming are certainly mind-dependent, but there is certainly also something in the skin of the red apple which is different from the skin of a green one. 

Nick: "Likewise, intrinsic goodness is not a property of external, mind-independent objects."

Likewise, to the starving man the nourishment of the apple is intrinsically good, due in part to the actual constitution of the apple and part to the actual constitution of the man. The "goodness" is not located in either the man or the apple, but in the satisfaction of the need for food. 

Nick: "Doing crack or heroin is NOT conducive to OVERALL happiness/pleasure."

If Philip Seymour Hoffman went out in a state of bliss then the extent of his happiness was maximized overall, because after the bliss it was all over for him. His choice to abandon his previous recovery to follow that happiness was a moral error, because it did him the ultimate harm rather then making things better. 

Nick: "Life is intrinsically good? What does that mean? That means we should procreate as much as possible? We should never kill any animals? We should outlaw euthanasia and force people to live healthy at gunpoint? What is intrinsically good about life?"

I would suggest that everyone here is in agreement that life is intrinsically good. Those who sincerely disagree have already left the discussion. Anyone who remains has either already answered the question "why is life good?" for themselves or finds the question trivial and irrelevant.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I actually don't think that life is intrinsically good.  If it were, then I would never be able to ask "why is life worth living?"

If life is the only intrinsic good, then there is nothing bad or evil about Hell, because in Hell your soul or spirit or whatever is guaranteed eternal perpetual existence.  But you already stated that you consider Hell to be extreme evil, that is not the life itself, but the quality of life that matters.

Hedonists associate the quality of life with the mental states that we experience.  Thus, "happiness" is not just physical pleasure, but incorporates a broad variety of positive experiences such as love.

"If Philip Seymour Hoffman went out in a state of bliss then the extent of his happiness was maximized overall, because after the bliss it was all over for him. His choice to abandon his previous recovery to follow that happiness was a moral error, because it did him the ultimate harm rather then making things better."

No, because Philip Seymour Hoffman died, which means that all the potential future happiness that he could have had had he not died was lost.  Thus, it was indeed harmful rather than good, because his happiness was -not- maximized in the long run.  I think you're still not getting how important this whole notion of overall happiness requires thinking not just about present momentary bliss, but about long term positive states of experience.

"Whether the fish experiences pleasure or not is a matter of speculation."

On the contrary, fish have brains which contain many of the same basic lower level structures as humans.  They have nociceptors, which means they almost certainly feel some kind of pain.  They may not experience consciousness at the same level as we do, but they very probably experience something.

"But whether the fish is diseased or dying can be observed. Whether the fish needs water and food can be observed. Whether the fish is harmed by toxic chemicals can be observed. So we can know empirically what is good for the fish and what is bad for the fish."

But whether the plant is diseased or dying can be observed. Whether the plant needs water and food can be observed. Whether the plant is harmed by toxic chemicals can be observed. So we can know empirically what is good for the plant and what is bad for the plant.

What makes a plant different from a human or a fish?  The difference is subjective experience.  A plant doesn't feel.  Therefore it has no moral worth to a hedonist.  If life is intrinsically valuable, then we must assign moral worth to plants, bacteria, cancer cells, and other lower lifeforms.

Your body is constantly killing billions of viruses and bacteria.  What about their needs?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[DL: "If life is the only intrinsic good, then there is nothing bad or evil about Hell, because in Hell your soul or spirit or whatever is guaranteed eternal perpetual existence."

I do agree with you that quality of life is intrinsically important to life and that seeking good for oneself and others is specifically intended to improve the quality of life for everyone. 

Further, if the quality of life is insufferable with no hope of improvement, then death, as painless as possible, is a moral option to end suffering. 

DL: "Hedonists associate the quality of life with the mental states that we experience."

And I hold that the correlation is insufficient for moral guidance. The mental state is easily manipulated and, often as not, will reward you for things that reduce the overall quality of your life. 

Adding to all the other examples of mental state misdirection would be mental illness. Take for example the post-partum depression that causes some new mothers to kill their children or take their own life. It would be better that their mental state be addressed and healed rather than following its lead. 

Quality of life is not about how the mother feels about her children, but whether they are alive or dead after she is healed. 

DL: "No, because Philip Seymour Hoffman died, which means that all the potential future happiness that he could have had had he not died was lost.  Thus, it was indeed harmful rather than good, because his happiness was -not- maximized in the long run.  I think you're still not getting how important this whole notion of overall happiness requires thinking not just about present momentary bliss, but about long term positive states of experience."

I don't think you can guarantee Hoffman that the accumulation of happiness in the future would outweigh his fatal injection of happiness. After all, he will endure the pangs of withdrawal and will wish for another hit for a very long time. And he could be hit by a truck tomorrow. 

And Nick's comment suggests he's ready to get plugged into the happiness machine until death because of his take on hedonism, that mental state is everything. 

DL: "But whether the plant is diseased or dying can be observed. Whether the plant needs water and food can be observed. Whether the plant is harmed by toxic chemicals can be observed. So we can know empirically what is good for the plant and what is bad for the plant."

That is correct. And a botanist would be capable of heading the First Church of Begonias and delivering accurate and beneficial commandments to be followed to insure a good quality of life for the plant. 

DL: "What makes a plant different from a human or a fish?"

Actually, there is nothing different about constructing an objectively correct ethical system based upon the best possible good for all plants or all fish or any other living creature. The rules will be different for each species of course. 

DL: "A plant doesn't feel. Therefore it has no moral worth to a hedonist."

And yet the botanist can tell you what is good for the plant and what is bad for the plant. He can provide you with the rules of care that enhance the plant's quality of life, allowing the plant to bloom, and to bloom more abundantly. 

DL: "If life is intrinsically valuable, then we must assign moral worth to plants, bacteria, cancer cells, and other lower lifeforms."

Moral worth is species relevant. When I had a cat I cared for it because it was of value to me. From the cat's point of view, I was of moral value to it, because I made sure it got fed and had a fresh litter box. 

From the human's perspective, wildlife has value as a source of beauty, food, comparative behavior, etc. But if it comes down to a final battle between humans and cats, I'll be fighting on the side of my own species. 

The same applies to bacteria. We look at them from a human perspective, appreciating those that aid our digestion, but seeking to destroy those that might uncaringly destroy us. 

So the microbiologist studies the needs of different strains of bacteria to discover what benefits the ones that help us and what will destroy the ones that would hurt us. 

In doing so, we discover what is good or beneficial or improves the quality of life for the bacteria we like and what is bad for the bacteria we do not like. 

The same scientific objectivity can be applied to ourselves. And we have a host of medical doctors, psychologists, sociologists, etc. to help us understand more objectively what is truly good for us and what is truly bad for us.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["- The feeling of happiness is endorphins. Whatever you do to feel happy is also what you do to release endorphins."

Not that this matters much, but the actual feeling of happiness is more associated with Serotonin than endorphins.

"- It is not good for a species to overpopulate its territory and destroy its habitability and its ability to sustain a good quality of life."

How do you define "good quality of life"?

"People can identify actual benefits, things that are truly good for us, and actual harms, things that may be bad for us in actions, rules, and events. And these terms are more meaningful in discussions of morals and ethics, and more likely to produce eventual resolution and agreement on moral matters."

Then by all means, identify some actual benefits, things that are truly good for us, and explain how they would have nothing to do with increasing long term happiness or decreasing long term suffering.

"Benefits and harms may be quantifiable and observed in empirical scenarios. The “happiness” criteria is more likely to be both subjective and divisive."

But it seems like people can disagree about what is a benefit to someone based on their perceived moral theory.  Happiness is objectively subjective, that is to say, if you ask someone if their happy, they can tell you and there's no disagreement over whether or not it's the case, because only they know if they're happy or not, and they know.  It's not an opinion, but fact.

You still haven't answered whether it would be better to have fewer needs or more needs.

Perhaps you don't like "happiness" because it seems so subjective and arbitrary.  What do you think about Aristotle's notion of "Eudaimonia" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia)?]]></wp:comment_content>

Marvin, do you think that ethics should only be applied to general rules, or can it more directly be applied to individual actions?  The first statement I quoted from you seems to imply the latter, which would be Act Utilitarianism, while your second statement implies the former, which is Rule Utilitarianism.

Which are you advocating here?]]></wp:comment_content>

It is not feelings guiding us about what is good. It is the pleasant feelings themselves that are good on my view. I think you may be attacking a strawman. A hedonist would NOT say that just because you feel happy about X, X is good all things considered. Rather, the hedonist would say that, because you feel happy about X, X is pro tanto good. You must determine X's effects on others and on the future before you can determine whether X is good all things considered.

"Benefits and harms may be quantifiable and observed in empirical scenarios. The “happiness” criteria is more likely to be both subjective and divisive."

I think this is false. It is an objective fact of the matter whether or not someone is in a pleasant or unpleasant state of consciousness. On the other hand, analyzing 'benefits' and 'harms', or 'good' and 'bad', in non-hedonistic terms is subjective. You have to use your sense of approval or disapproval. But what you approve and disapprove of may be different from what someone else approves or disapproves of. The hedonist is on more objective ground, because we claim that pleasure is good and pain is bad, no matter the source. If the quantities are equal, the pleasure that results from going to the opera is no better than the pleasure that results from going to the strip club. There is no subjectivity in this standard.

What is this "quality of life" that you speak of? How do you measure it? How do you know what is good or bad, or beneficial or harmful?

How do you distinguish real needs from desires? What if someone else has a different opinion?

You said when needs conflict, you need to find the best good possible. What is good, on your view? And what if someone else disagrees?

"Benefits and harms may be quantifiable and observed in empirical scenarios."

How so? How do I know when something that I observe is a benefit or a harm? Where does value enter in my sense perception?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nick: "I'm guessing you have some idealist rather than hedonistic interpretation of 'utility'."

Actually I have a pragmatic view of 'utility'. It simply means "useful to some purpose", and that purpose may be for good or for evil. 

The gift from the Utilitarians to the philosophy of Ethics was that rules serve a purpose. Once you know the use of a rule you can objectively evaluate how well it meets that purpose, so that you can tell a good rule (ACA) from a bad rule (slavery). 

This gets us past the deontologists who think rules are fixed by "nature", "God", or whatever they want to use to nail the rule to the floor with so that it doesn't change willy-nilly (abolition of slavery, gay marriage, 20 week abortion rule). 

Where the utilitarians go wrong is use "pleasure" and "pain avoidance" as the goal of ethics. They confuse feeling good with actual goodness. And if everybody's guide to ethical behavior was simply to do whatever feels good, we'd all be hooked on crack or heroin. 

The "future happiness" argument suggests that if we could be hooked for the rest of our lives, that it would then be okay. (I saw in the news that heroin is cheaper than Oxycontin these days and it's use has doubled recently). 

Oh, reminds me of a quote a guy at the office had on the wall: William Blake once said, "The Road of Excess Leads to the Palace of Wisdom".

Nick: "For us hedonists, happiness (or pleasant consciousness) IS goodness. Nothing else is intrinsically good."

Reminds me of Colbert saying that it must be true if he feels it in his gut. 

Only life is intrinsically good. All other goods are relevant to their beneficial or detrimental effect upon the quality of life. 

Because the pursuit of happiness leads to a lot of unhappiness, it makes more sense to pursue goodness itself, and decide to feel happy about achieving it.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["I’m still not happy with that definition."

You're right. A utilitarian can define 'utility' in terms of something else, like preference-satisfaction or some idealist interpretation of welfare. I'm guessing you have some idealist rather than hedonistic interpretation of 'utility'. I should have said, a hedonistic utilitarian wants to maximize overall happiness (or pleasant consciousness) summed over all of space and time.

"But if something is in fact good for us, then it is good for us regardless how we feel about it."

As a hedonist, I deny this. I think intrinsic goodness just is pleasant consciousness (or feeling good). So, on my interpretation, good for us is the same as pleasant for us. Although something can be immediately pleasant, but conducive to overall unpleasantness (like over-indulgence in appetitive pleasures).

"And since we often feel good about things that are bad for us..."

I only agree with this statement if it is amended to:
"Since we often feel good about things that are OVERALL bad for us.."

"Happiness is an unreliable guide to goodness."
For us hedonists, happiness (or pleasant consciousness) IS goodness. Nothing else is intrinsically good.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A necessary harm would be the inoculations against communicable diseases we get as kids, or the penalty for a crime, or the bodily harm during delivery of a newborn. They prevent future harm. 

I prefer to use the terms "good" or "benefit" for things that are actually good for us rather than "happiness" for the reasons I've described. And I use the more general term "harm" for things that are bad for us, injure us, or cause us suffering. 

Because our feelings often deceive us as to what is actually good or bad for us, I believe that the feeling of "happiness" is an unreliable guide to moral behavior. That is a fatal flaw in any hedonistic ethics in my opinion. 

People can identify actual benefits, things that are truly good for us, and actual harms, things that may be bad for us in actions, rules, and events. And these terms are more meaningful in discussions of morals and ethics, and more likely to produce eventual resolution and agreement on moral matters. 

The problem of meta-ethics would be to resolve language barriers that get in the way of addressing moral issues in a meaningful way. 

Benefits and harms may be quantifiable and observed in empirical scenarios. The "happiness" criteria is more likely to be both subjective and divisive. 

So that's my evaluation of hedonistic utilitarianism. 

Touching on the other points you raised:

- Evil takes pleasure in causing harm. Morality takes pleasure in doing and being good. 

- The feeling of happiness is endorphins. Whatever you do to feel happy is also what you do to release endorphins. 

- When needs conflict you do the best you can in the situation to achieve the best good possible for everyone involved. I offer you no answers at this point, but only a better formulation of the question. 

- Buddhists distinguish real needs from desires, which they consider illusionary. Their message is that a lot of suffering is due to desiring things which we do not really need. 

- You know that reality is real because if everything was your mind in a vat then nothing would be different, so the problem is irrelevant. 

- Penalty is about restitution, correction and protection. The victim deserves restitution. The criminal deserves correction, but not one inch of penalty beyond what is reasonably necessary to do that. And the rest of us deserve protection from crimes. 

- It is not good for a species to overpopulate its territory and destroy its habitability and its ability to sustain a good quality of life.

Let me know if I missed anything.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Moral intent applies to both. The moral person intends to act well (in a way that benefits himself and others) and may develop personal rules of behavior that are useful to that end (for example: exercise and diet, gifts to charitable causes, voting, etc.) 

A "good Samaritan" may come to someone's aid without being required to do so by law. This is a moral act, motivated by the desire to improve someone else's good and/or reduce harm. A mother may come to her child's aid from love rather than duty. The act is moral if it's effect is greater good and/or and less harm. 

The ethical rules, personal and/or social, evolve over time as our moral sense improves and we experience the results of our actions. 

Laws likewise evolve in the same way. They are an agreement between us as to what social behavior ought to be required or prohibited to accomplish the best results for everyone. 

Both rules (55 mph limit on the highway) and acts (giving a hungry man a sandwich) are instruments of our moral intent. Both rules and acts are judged by their utility toward that end.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[But what if a rule and an act conflict?  I might say that as a rule, lying is wrong, because generally lying causes people to have incorrect information and make mistakes that can harm them.  On the other hand, what if you're in World War II Germany and you're hiding Jews in your basement and a Nazi comes to your door and demands to know if you seen any Jews lately?  Most people would agree that you should break your rule to save the Jews in your basement.

But if that's the case, rules are nothing more than heuristic guidelines that we follow until we find an exception.  Do you believe that rules are somehow more than that?

"If the ends are simply to eliminate pain and increase pleasure then your results may be immoral. Childbirth is painful, but it is necessary to avoid extinction of the human species. Cocaine and heroin may be pleasurable, but they also enslave you to ends which are not actually good for you."

I can argue that even though Childbirth is painful, it is an acceptable sacrifice to allow a child into this world, which will create significantly more pleasure in the long run, not only for the child, but also for the parent.  Conversely, drug addiction may be pleasurable on a physical level, but it actually tends to lead to more pain on balance because the addiction destroys the life of the person, and thwarts higher pleasures like the happiness that comes from accomplishing life goals.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[(A) Yes, I certainly do agree that rules are not absolute. Rules are supposed to serve morality, but when you're hiding Anne Frank's family from the Nazi's it would be immoral to share that truth with Gestapo. That's why it is important to put Ethics in its proper place, which is below rather than above Good. 

Principles are short, easily remembered rule statements. In theory, one might outline a principle in sufficient detail to cover all possible choices in all circumstances. But that is simply not practical. Therefore we presume there will be reasonable exceptions to most rule statements. 

To better know when to make an exception, we need to know what the rule is supposed to accomplish (what is it's utility): the best possible good and least possible harm for everyone. 

(B) I think it's a stretch to suggest that all moral issues might be resolved in terms of their ultimate tally of pleasure versus pain. Hoffman's death by heroin overdose was certainly effective at pain relief, but it would be hard to say that this was a morally good result. 

Pleasure and pain are biological clues to what may be good and bad for us, but they are not entirely reliable. Every self-destructive addiction is fueled following pleasure and avoiding pain at any cost. 

Moral judgment must look beyond simple pleasure and pain cues if we are live our best lives. Instead we must look to whether the act or rule is actually beneficial to our lives and the lives of others.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[What if I replaced the terms pleasure and pain, with happiness and suffering?  I think there's a tendency to assume that pleasure means only immediate physical pleasure, and pain, immediate physical pain, when in fact, most Hedonistic Utilitarians actually mean to refer to any positively or negatively valenced emotional or mental experience.  Perhaps Happiness and Suffering capture these definitions better.

In this sense, Hoffman's death was morally bad because of all the future pleasure or happiness that he is denied by it.

How do you define beneficial to our lives?  What is actually good, other than what we and others actually experience in terms of happiness or positive emotional/mental states in the long run?  What does a "best life" look like?

Epicurus actually argued a long time ago that the best life is a life of pleasure in moderation, while Aristotle argued that the best life involved some objective state of well-being called "Eudaimonia".  I'm actually quite sympathetic to the notion of Eudaimonia, but the difficulty I find with it is that it is difficult in practice to measure.  We as subjects can directly experience our happiness and suffering, but Eudaimonia may well include things we are unaware of.  Perhaps Eudaimonia is determinable from the perspective of a being with perfect information about everything, but most of us know only what we feel and what we perceive of the outside world with our limited senses.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[(A) One key thing I forgot to add. Pleasure/happiness and pain/suffering are part physical and part "spiritual" (not ghosts, but rather the combination of attitude and emotion that affect the "spirit" in which we experience things). This mental state is both significant and malleable. It is significant because a person can mentally adjust his reaction to physical pain, reducing it by relaxation techniques (e.g. in the dentist chair) or by concentrating on the benefits on the other side of the suffering (e.g., the better life after overcoming an addiction). In a more common scenario, a person may do the right thing in a spirit of resentment and obligation or with a spirit of joyful service. It is malleable because we can, either alone or with help, shed a bad attitude and acquire a better one. (I define the "holy spirit" as "feeling good about doing good and being good"). 

(B) We call something "good" if it meets a real need that we have as an individual, as a society, or as a species. (You might want to make a note of that) Life implies need. An amoeba extends a pseudopod seeking food. A flower twists to face the sun. A baby cries out for food and comfort. Satisfying a "real" need is actually good for us. Satisfying our wants and desires may not always be so good. We need nourishing food, but we want cake. That's another case where the pain/pleasure provides false results. 

I presume that "hedonistic utilitarianism" would be oriented toward pain/pleasure, and therefore pursues a false "good" (hey, any theists out there may replace that with "false god" if you wish). 

With today's medical science, we have lots of objective evidence as to what is actually good for us, and lots of self-help gurus spreading the word. My mom likes Dr. Oz. And there are those preaching spiritual practices like meditation, etc. And psychologists and ministers concerned with how we feel about things. So we may have some advantages over Epicurus. Still some ancient recommendations are still valid, like "moderation in all things". 

(C) My main point is that "good" is the center of morality and that morality is the center of all ethical philosophy. Different schools and approaches may be judged by how well they lead to the center or lead us astray.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["No, because the flu vaccination is still no pleasure even when it is really needed."

The point of Utilitarianism is to maximize utility.  If utility means pleasure, a flu vaccination is still utility maximizing because if you subtract the brief pain of the needle and then add the pleasure of not getting sick, you find that it ends up being positive.  The needle is still bad, but we consider it, on balance to be worth it.

The same is true for things like your earlier example of cake.  Eating the cake will create a temporary pleasure, but the pain that comes from later health problems and being fat outweigh that fleeting pleasure and so make it inadvisable.

A gang member may feel happy about shooting someone.  The fact of the matter is that regardless of how the happiness is created, it is a good experience for the person who experiences it.  The problem with this situation is that this happiness was created by causing someone else suffering.  Thus when you weigh the temporary elation that comes from the power  trip of shooting someone against the permanent loss of all the happiness that the person who was shot could experience, the math comes up strongly negative and implies that the situation is still wrong.

"So we really need to decide what is good for us before we can determine what we ought to feel happy about."

Okay then, what do you suggest is good for us if not our happiness?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["A gang member may feel happy about shooting someone in a competing gang. It is not a reliable guide to what is good."

Just to add my two cents. For me at least, happiness is not really a guide to what is good. You're suggesting that there is an epistemological relationship, such that feeling happiness in response to X gives us the knowledge that X is good. I think it's a metaphysical relationship, such that feeling happiness in response to X is what makes X good (or pro tanto good, since X's goodness could be outweighed if it turned out that X has an overall net loss in happiness).

Happiness itself, or more generally, pleasant consciousness/experience is good in itself, and everything else is merely instrumentally good or bad, depending on how much it promotes pleasant experience. So just because one feels happy about some event (or feels pleasant when perceiving or contemplating some event) does not mean the event produces an overall net gain in pleasantness (summed over all of space and time).

My view on why people tend to think things other than pleasant consciousness can be intrinsically good is that they have a sense of approval when considering some action. The sense of approval is accompanied by pleasant consciousness, and the subject projects this feeling of pleasantness (intrinsic goodness) onto the external world phenomena itself, rather than recognizing it as a part of one's experience.

We have a sense of disapproval when we contemplate a gang member engaging in violent behavior. This disapproval is accompanied by unpleasant consciousness, which causes us to project the idea of badness onto the idea of violent behavior. Because of the tendency of violent behavior to produce net losses of pleasant consciousness, we have a deeply ingrained negative and unpleasant response (disapproval) to such behavior. This is probably both due to our moral eduction by our parents and society, as well as our evolutionary past dealing with harmful things.

What I just wrote may have been unclear, irrelevant, or simply erroneous, so ignore it in those cases.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[DL: "The point of Utilitarianism is to maximize utility."

Then utilitarianism is an amoral philosophy and useless in the study of ethics. But I don't believe your definition is correct. The contribution of Utilitarianism to the field of ethics is to point out that rules are not ends in themselves, but rather that rules serve a purpose and we follow them to achieve that goal. So that the rule has an objective criteria to evaluate it's effect. 

DL: "If utility means pleasure, a flu vaccination is still utility maximizing because if you subtract the brief pain of the needle and then add the pleasure of not getting sick, you find that it ends up being positive.  The needle is still bad, but we consider it, on balance to be worth it."

Right, except for the pleasure part. Ideally, we should take pleasure in that which is truly good for us. 

We can both agree that coming down with the flu is bad for us and that the vaccination is therefore good for us, so we may then allow ourselves to take pleasure about enduring the pain of the needle. 

DL: "A gang member may feel happy about shooting someone.  The fact of the matter is that regardless of how the happiness is created, it is a good experience for the person who experiences it."

And that would be a different definition of "good", where you equate "good feelings" (pleasure) with moral good. Although it is a pleasant experience for the shooter, it is not in fact good for the shooter. The shooter has in fact harmed himself by taking pleasure from inflicting harm on others. 

DL: "Okay then, what do you suggest is good for us if not our happiness?"

Well, like I said, the best I've come up with is that we call something "good" if it meets a real need that we have as an individual, a society, or a species. 

That is the underlying definition that I sense when people generally discuss moral issues. Take the speed limit for example, increasing the limit raises the probability of unnecessary injury or death, two things that we all agree are "bad" for people. On the other hand, we wish to get from here to there expeditiously, and we are willing to take a risk by getting behind the wheel in the first place. So we weigh the benefits and harms of different speeds and take a vote to establish a working rule. 

We really need to travel to get to work, to get to the store, etc. We really need to avoid unnecessary accidents. The best good for everyone is to optimize meeting both needs. 

And I think that is the process of moral judgment that we go through everyday to choose what we do and to reach agreement upon the ethical rules.]]></wp:comment_content>

Exactly. Our emotional responses, which include pleasure and happiness are malleable. Whether we feel terror and outrage when a cat is boiled and skinned or simply salivate in expectation of dinner is culturally conditioned. (See "Cat meat" in Wikipedia and sorry for the horrid example, but it makes the point). 

So we cannot rely upon feelings of pleasure or happiness as a guide to moral action. The rules are already established in the culture and their children's feelings are already conditioned according to the rules. 

I believe that relying on a "feeling of rightness" would be a deontological system and that deontological systems merely conserve the ethics in place, and so cannot be used to judge them (or fix them when they're wrong). 

Nick: "This is probably both due to our moral education by our parents and society, as well as our evolutionary past dealing with harmful things."

Indeed.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["Then utilitarianism is an amoral philosophy and useless in the study of ethics."

Quote (Wikipedia):

"Utility is usefulness, the ability of something to satisfy needs or wants."

In other words, maximizing utility means maximizing the good.

Utilitarianism can basically be summed up with the old adage: "The Greatest Good for the Greatest Number."

"Well, like I said, the best I’ve come up with is that we call something “good” if it meets a real need that we have as an individual, a society, or a species."

"We really need to travel to get to work, to get to the store, etc. We really need to avoid unnecessary accidents. The best good for everyone is to optimize meeting both needs."

Why do we need those things?  Because they are means to some end.  What is the ultimate end?  What is the purpose of it all?  What is the meaning of life?

I'll let you in on a secret.  The meaning of life is whatever you want it to be.  We as human beings, as self-directed agents, are free to choose whatever meaning or purpose we want our lives to have.  Even if God existed and decided that the purpose of human beings was to be food for Angels, that would only be God's purpose for us.  As beings with free will, we can decide to have our own purpose, separate from what anyone else wants of us.

So if the meaning of life can be anything, what should it be?  That is where morality comes in.  Morality answers the question of what should be the meaning of life by saying it should be to do what is right.

So what is right?  The truth is right.  And the truth is that we all have an ultimate end goal.  The truth is that some experiences are intrinsically good.  Happiness is the emotional goal state that we all seek to achieve.  It is the ultimate end, and it is also the intrinsic good.  Morality therefore says that we should maximize the happiness of everyone.

That is what Hedonistic Utilitarianism argues.

"So we cannot rely upon feelings of pleasure or happiness as a guide to moral action. The rules are already established in the culture and their children’s feelings are already conditioned according to the rules."

Happiness is not a guide to moral action.  It is the end of all actions.  Seriously ask yourself why you are doing the things that you do.  Ask yourself why?  Why?  Why?

If you do this, you will eventually find that the ultimate goal of every action is to feel happy, or make others feel happy.

The satisfaction of needs creates happiness in the long run.

"That is the underlying definition that I sense when people generally discuss moral issues. Take the speed limit for example, increasing the limit raises the probability of unnecessary injury or death, two things that we all agree are “bad” for people. "

Why is unnecessary injury or death bad?  Because injury is suffering, and death the permanent destruction of any future happiness.

Seriously think about this.  What is a need?  Wikipedia says that: "A need is something that is necessary for organisms to live a healthy life."

Why should organisms live a healthy life?  What point is there in being healthy and living?  Are health and life intrinsic goods?  If I am healthy and living, but my life is otherwise hell, is it still good that I am alive?

Let me ask you two questions.  What is good about the concept of going to Heaven?  What is bad about the concept of going to Hell?  In both conditions the spirit is free of physical needs.  It cannot die or be unhealthy.  But in Heaven, there is only eternal happiness, and in Hell, only eternal suffering.

Do you see my point yet?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The utility of Utilitarianism as a moral guide depends upon it's ability to enhance good and reduce harm for everyone in general. This is the goal of morality. The moral evaluation of any ethical philosophy applies this criteria. 

The concept of "utility" itself is amoral until you answer the question "useful to do what?", and that's what I'm examining here. 

DL: "Quote (Wikipedia): 'Utility is usefulness, the ability of something to satisfy needs or wants.' In other words, maximizing utility means maximizing the good."

Hitler wanted to dominate the world and purge it of Jews. The gas chambers certainly had utility toward that end. But we cannot call that "good". 

DL: "Utilitarianism can basically be summed up with the old adage: ,The Greatest Good for the Greatest Number.' "

And the Jews were a minority race. Still no valid moral guidance here. Our moral goal must be to achieve the best possible good for everyone.

DL: "We as human beings, as self-directed agents, are free to choose whatever meaning or purpose we want our lives to have."

Which again fails to restrict Hitler. 

DL: "Happiness is the emotional goal state that we all seek to achieve.  It is the ultimate end, and it is also the intrinsic good."

And through propaganda and his personal charisma, Hitler made people happy to follow his agenda (or at least increased their suffering if they resisted). 

As I've state before, "happiness" and "pleasure" are malleable. They can be manipulated and trained. After you have been trained to feel happy about ignoring the needs of others or even harming others (gang culture, racial or religious hatred, anti-abortion to the point of shooting doctors, etc.) then the utility of happiness as a moral guide is lost. 

The moral utility of religion, for example, is to train us to feel good about doing good and being good, and to encourage a feeling of guilt about doing bad or being bad. 

DL: "The satisfaction of needs creates happiness in the long run."

If something that we really do need for our true benefit is satisfied, then it is actually "good", regardless how we feel about it. Happiness is a gift we grant ourselves, and its moral utility is when it is granted to reward our doing and being good. 

DL: "If I am healthy and living, but my life is otherwise hell, is it still good that I am alive?"

There are two heavens and two hells. One pair are external. The other is internal. It is said that some Christians sang songs of praise as they entered the arena to be eaten by lions. There external circumstance was hell, but their internal circumstance was heaven. 

If you are healthy and alive, then maybe you should be grateful and hold to the hope that whatever temporary suffering you are enduring will not last forever. 

DL: "But in Heaven, there is only eternal happiness, and in Hell, only eternal suffering."

Since eternal torture with no hope of relief can never be considered a morally valid penalty, I would have to reject any concept of a god that would apply it. 

The point of "God" is to support "Good", and if it supports "Evil" instead then we call it the "Devil". 

DL: "Wikipedia says that: 'A need is something that is necessary for organisms to live a healthy life.' "

That seems a reasonable reference to our basic physical needs. Satisfying those basic needs is generally a good thing. And it is not only a good thing for the majority ("greatest number"), but for everyone. 

And the social order we use to enhance our ability to do this would also be a good thing.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[When I say, "for the greatest number" that is essentially a compromise saying that it may not be possible to make everyone happy in all circumstances.  This is why I actually prefer the statement:

"Maximize the happiness of everyone".

Please explain to me what is not good about maximizing the happiness of everyone.

"Since eternal torture with no hope of relief can never be considered a morally valid penalty, I would have to reject any concept of a god that would apply it."

But doesn't this rely on the assumption that there is something intrinsically evil about torture?  If the only good is meeting basic needs, and the only evil not meeting basic needs, I don't see how you can reach this assumption.

Let me try this again from a different direction.

If you truly love someone, do you just want their basic needs to be satisfied, or do you want them to be truly happy in the best possible sense?

The evil of Hitler comes from the fact that he killed six million Jews.  That is six million lives who's potential happiness was annihilated.  Even if the majority of Germans approved of this and were happy about it, this kind of superficial happiness at the expense of others is not and can never be happiness maximizing.

Strictly speaking Hedonistic Utilitarianism argues that it is only right if it actually maximizes happiness.

"As I’ve state before, “happiness” and “pleasure” are malleable. They can be manipulated and trained. After you have been trained to feel happy about ignoring the needs of others or even harming others (gang culture, racial or religious hatred, anti-abortion to the point of shooting doctors, etc.) then the utility of happiness as a moral guide is lost."

Even so, it is a fact that the feeling of happiness itself, separate from why you are feeling happy, is a positive experience.  That a good thing (the feeling of happiness) can be twisted by others for evil purposes, does not make it less good.

Needs are also malleable.  If I am sufficiently clever, I can devise some scheme where the only way to satisfy your needs is to deny someone else their basic needs.  For instance, perhaps you are on a deserted island with a friend and there is only one bottle of water left.  You happen to know that you will be rescued eventually, but there isn't enough water left for both of you to survive and be rescued in time.  There is only enough water for one of you.  What do you do?  What is moral in this situation?

"And through propaganda and his personal charisma, Hitler made people happy to follow his agenda (or at least increased their suffering if they resisted)."

And through the power of the state and his social manipulation, Hitler made people depend on following his agenda in order to meet their basic needs, because in order to eat they had to participate in an economy that enabled the Holocaust.  Workers built those gas chambers not because they wanted to build gas chambers, but because they needed to eat.

Similarly, Stalin and Mao made everyone dependent on the communist state for survival.  In order to meet their basic needs, they had to obey the doctrines of Communism which led to significant numbers of deaths from famine and Gulags and cultural revolutions and so on.

Therefore, satisfying needs is not generally a good thing because people's needs can be manipulated for evil purposes.

See, I can play this game too. XD]]></wp:comment_content>

Okay. Everyone is hooked up to automated heroin intravenous drip and the dosage is slowly increased until everyone dies in a state of bliss. I think that would be a bad thing because of species extinction. We call something good if it meets a real need that we have as an individual, a society, or as a species. Failing to meet the need of the species to survive, makes it a bad thing. 

DL: "But doesn't this rely on the assumption that there is something intrinsically evil about torture?"

Torture, by definition, is an unnecessary harm inflicted on one person for the benefit of another. Torture is bad because the harm is uncalled for. Torture is evil when the person inflicting it takes pleasure or happiness in inflicting it. 
 
(Evil is a matter of intent. It is the direct opposite of morality, which is also a matter of intent.)

DL: "If you truly love someone, do you just want their basic needs to be satisfied, or do you want them to be truly happy in the best possible sense?"

I think Jesus once said, "I have come that ye may have life, and ye may have it abundantly". And I generally agree with that sentiment. 

Happiness in the "best possible sense" would be the joy granted upon doing  the best good and being the best person you can. 

Happiness is the M&amp;M candy that positively reinforces good behavior. We control our own happiness by the release of endorphins. 

The moral issue is what we choose to be happy about. 

DL: "Workers built those gas chambers not because they wanted to build gas chambers, but because they needed to eat."

So the need was not malleable. If the workers could change their real need to eat then they could have resisted Hitler. To resist Hitler, they would have to change what they were happy about, because that is within their control. People have gone on hunger strikes to make a strong political statement, ignoring the pain for a higher good. 

DL: "Therefore, satisfying needs is not generally a good thing because people's needs can be manipulated for evil purposes."

Withholding food to extort compliance would be a bad thing to do, precisely because food is necessary and therefore good for the victim. 

DL: "For instance, perhaps you are on a deserted island with a friend and there is only one bottle of water left."

Have you heard the parable of the five libertarians stranded on the island? The one who owned the boat asked his four friends to join him for a ride. A storm arose, crashing the boat on an island. But a chest of canned food was rescued from the boat. The owner said, "I know you are all principled men and will respect my right to all of this food. We don't know how long we will be stranded, and it may turn out that at least I will survive until help comes."  Three days later the Coast Guard rescued four socialists from the island. 

(And, no, I don't advocate socialism, but I think it's a better punch line.)]]></wp:comment_content>

This may not maximize overall happiness. If everyone dies, that means happiness ends. So there might be more total happiness if everyone continues to live at a lower level of happiness but for much longer duration. A utilitarian doesn't want to maximize immediate happiness but overall happiness (summed over all of time and space).

"The moral issue is what we choose to be happy about."

As a utilitarian, I agree. We ought to choose, to the extent possible, to be happy about things that satisfy long term universal happiness. If we cultivate happiness towards unhealthy things, or towards things that are harmful to others, overall happiness won't be maximized.]]></wp:comment_content>

I would argue that this bad because this doesn't actually maximize happiness.  Maximizing happiness means maximizing happiness in the long run and for people who don't yet exist.  If everyone dies, they cease to be capable of experiencing happiness, or producing more people who can experience happiness.  Again, you're associating pleasure with lower level physical stimulation pleasures.  I actually think there are higher pleasures, like the pleasure of reading an enjoyable book, or having meaningful relationships with friends, that count as greater pleasures because they please the full mind, rather than just the opiate neurons.  Do you not think there is something good about enjoying, for instance, this hearty debate that we're having right now?

"Torture, by definition, is an unnecessary harm inflicted on one person for the benefit of another. Torture is bad because the harm is uncalled for. Torture is evil when the person inflicting it takes pleasure or happiness in inflicting it.

(Evil is a matter of intent. It is the direct opposite of morality, which is also a matter of intent.)"

But what intent?  The harm is uncalled for?  So you think that harming someone who deserves it would be right?

I think torture is evil because of the suffering it causes the person experiencing the torture, that just seems a lot more straightforward.  Torture is bad regardless of whether or not anyone else benefits from it.  Causing pain can only be justified because it prevents greater future pain or leads to greater happiness later.

"Happiness is the M&amp;M candy that positively reinforces good behavior. We control our own happiness by the release of endorphins."

You can control the release of endorphins in your brain?  Wow.  I know I can't.  If I could do that I'd be doing it all day. XD

"So the need was not malleable. If the workers could change their real need to eat then they could have resisted Hitler. To resist Hitler, they would have to change what they were happy about, because that is within their control. People have gone on hunger strikes to make a strong political statement, ignoring the pain for a higher good."

It is no less malleable than happiness.  People do go on hunger strikes, ignoring their need for food for a higher good.

"Have you heard the parable of the five libertarians stranded on the island? The one who owned the boat asked his four friends to join him for a ride. A storm arose, crashing the boat on an island. But a chest of canned food was rescued from the boat. The owner said, “I know you are all principled men and will respect my right to all of this food. We don’t know how long we will be stranded, and it may turn out that at least I will survive until help comes.” Three days later the Coast Guard rescued four socialists from the island."

That's kind of funny, but it doesn't really answer my question.  What happens if needs directly conflict?

And think about it this way.  Is a need itself good or bad?  Needs necessarily restrict us, the satisfaction of a need makes it temporarily go away.  If we all had no needs to satisfy, would that be good or bad?  What if we had many more needs to satisfy?

It seems to me like it would be better to have fewer needs, because it would be easier to satisfy the few needs with the limited resources of this universe, than having to satisfy many needs.  But this means that having no needs would actually be the best situation.

But that goes against the idea that the greatest good is the maximization of need satisfaction.  If the greatest good is to maximize need satisfaction, then we should encourage as many needs as possible so that there are more to satisfy.

So what is right?  To encourage a world without need, or with infinite need?  The Buddhists traditionally believe that we should try to need or crave as little as possible, that in the enlightened state of Nirvana, we should have no desires or needs, because then we cannot suffer.

"I think Jesus once said, “I have come that ye may have life, and ye may have it abundantly”. And I generally agree with that sentiment."

"I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live; also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil—this is God's gift to man." - Ecclesiastes 3:12-13

Interestingly, even the Dali Lama seems to think that happiness is the goal of life: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Happiness

At the end of the day, you have to ask, what makes a need a need, and not a want or desire.  Essentially, the only difference between a need and a want is that the need is required for us to maintain our state of existence.  Everything else, (esteem, self-actualization etc.), is arguably really a want that we can live without.  And even this "need" is only a need if we desire to exist.

So basically what you're saying is that a healthy life is intrinsically good, because the purpose of needs is to ensure a healthy life and nothing more.

In that case, we should be maximizing life, not need satisfaction.  So then, if life is what matters, then we should all be trying to have babies and forcing people to procreate.  But I bet you'd find something wrong with this. That there was something wrong with forcing people to have babies against their will.  But if life is all that matters, then what people want doesn't matter either.  A life of constant torture is no more or less valuable than a life of bliss.

I suspect you would reject this caricature, reasonably, because there is something good or bad about how people experience their lives.  You already accept that harm is bad for some reason.  Why not accept that the reason is that harm is just bad.

What do we know?  Really?  How do I know that I am not a brain in a vat being fed electrical impulses?  How do I know that reality is real?  I can reason that something exists, and that part of that something experiences subjective experiences.  I can also reason that some of these experiences feel positive, while others feel negative.  Aside from that, there is nothing that I can know for certain.  All other facts about the world come from assuming that I can trust my senses.

It is for this reason why I value happiness.  Happiness is a directly felt experience.  It does not depend on my senses, though it can be influenced by the information I receive from my senses.  But regardless how I come to be happy, the state itself is a good state to be in.  It is arguably the correct state, and suffering, the incorrect state, that a sentient being should or should not be in.

This is the core of my morality.  I believe that all sentient beings deserve to feel happiness rather than suffering.  How do we achieve this?  Well, clearly, we must satisfy everyone's needs, or else they won't be alive to feel happy.

See?  Happiness as a good is more inclusive than need satisfaction as a good.  It intrinsically incorporates elements of your theory into it as a means to achieving happiness.  Conversely, your theory by itself, would allow for worlds full of suffering and evil.

At the end of the day, a consequentialist morality like utilitarianism must choose one good to maximize over all others, that is to say, we must value something.

Needs are outside the mind.  We only sense that we need things because the failure to have those needs satisfied creates negative emotional/mental states, or destroys the capacity for emotional/mental states entirely.  Hunger is a negative mental state.  Feeling full is generally a positive state.  Evolution (or God if you want to believe in God), made us this way so that we would be motivated to survive and reproduce.  But we have evolved beyond this, and found that we can create positive mental states through doing things like reading good books, or having lively debates on the Internet.  Doing those things don't directly contribute to survival, but they are still "good" in the sense that they create good states in the subject.

Moral good comes from recognizing that from the perspective of an impartial outsider, we have no reason to prefer one person's happiness over another, but we do recognize the fact that the experience of positive states is good.  Thus, the fair and moral thing to do, is to maximize the positive states of all subjects.

We could argue instead that the satisfaction of a need is good.  But then we'd have to explain why.  The experience of happiness explains itself.  On the other hand, the experience of needing is actually usually a negative mental experience.  People don't enjoy being hungry.  We therefore don't want to maximize neediness.  Causing people to be very very hungry would be no different from torturing them.  We want to satisfy needs only because it makes those needy feelings go away.

Thus, when we satisfy needs, what we are actually doing is reducing or preventing suffering.]]></wp:comment_content>

I'm still not happy with that definition. :-) 

Nick: "If we cultivate happiness towards unhealthy things, or towards things that are harmful to others, overall happiness won't be maximized."

But if something is in fact good for us, then it is good for us regardless how we feel about it. 

And since we often feel good about things that are bad for us, we cannot rely upon our feelings of happiness to guide us to what is good for us. 

Happiness is an unreliable guide to goodness. What is actually good for us must be determined first, before we can safely enjoy it.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As much as we can try to ignore suffering, that doesn't mean the suffering just goes away.  The experience is real.  We feel regardless of what we want.

And why do we "need" anything?  What if I decide that I no longer value my life and don't care about living.  Do I still have "needs" if I am prepared to die?

Underlying needs is an assumption of value.  We value certain things like food, because they satisfy us, and make us feel well and create positive consequences.  If we didn't value that feeling of wellness, that satisfaction of the appetite, and the consequences of being healthy, we wouldn't value food.

So my question is, what do you truly value?  What makes life worth living?

Do you think a world filled with people who were being daily tortured for most of their waking hours, but had all their "needs" satisfied in terms of food and basic necessities, is a good world to live in?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[We don't "ignore suffering" but we may deal with it differently say, when we take a child to the doctor to get their vaccinations and when we get our annual flu shots. The temporary harm is tolerated to prevent a greater harm later. And the adult facing the needle with this knowledge is likely to suffer less (just physical pain) than the child who doesn't understand why he is being hurt (physical plus emotional pain). 

Real needs comes with life. A rock doesn't need anything. A robot needs what we tell it to need. The corpse is like a stone when it is no longer "animated". 

Maslow proposed a hierarchy of needs. Once the starving man is fed he may turn his concerns to higher order needs, like coming up with a way to avoid severe food deprivation again. 

Suicide is not a rational response to temporary or moderate suffering. There is no one left to experience the imagined relief. Nor is there anyone left to value anything. Questions of value are irrelevant to the dead. All values presume life. 

But we should also classify "values" along with "pleasure/pain" and "happiness/suffering" as partially malleable stuff. Part is physically innate and part is mental/emotional. Part is amenable to the physician and another part is amenable to the psychologist, the sociologist, and the priest. 

The broad question, "What makes life worth living?", may have radically different answers from the hedonist than from the Buddhist. And that suggests that not all of the answer is innate, but that part is subject to the mind's impact upon one's emotional life. 

The big question is "what is actually good for us?" or "what are the needs that are real for every living person?". And I think that these are not arbitrary, but rather derived from empirical evidence and reason.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think the whole notion of needs -is- somewhat arbitrary.  I only have basic physical needs if I want to exist.  To me, needs are actually wants that we assign special value to because we want them more than other things.

Maslow's Hierarchy is actually a good example of this.  Self-Actualization is by no means necessary for survival.  It is, to be honest, a want that Maslow highly valued.  Survival is also, by no means necessary.  There is no law of the universe that says we must exist.  Instead, we choose to exist, and can choose to not exist.  Thus, as existence itself is a choice, there are no absolute needs that must be fulfilled.  We are free in this sense.

Also, I take issue with the notion that needs are hierarchical.  I feel a want for self-actualization, even when I'm hungry.  I probably care more about knowing the meaning of life, than I do about self-esteem or having a roof over my head.  This is because I want my life to be meaningful, and value this more than most other things.

You accept that suicide is a rational response to intense suffering and the expectation that one's life will consist of nothing more than intense suffering in the future, correct?  Why?  Why should a life of nothing but torture, not be worth living?

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs could easily be called Maslow's Hierarchy of Pleasures.  What, to be honest, is the difference between Self-Actualization, and a high level sense of happiness that comes from feeling happy about the overall state of one's life?

Regarding, "what makes life worth living?" Just because people answer the question differently based on their limited knowledge and beliefs, doesn't mean there's no correct answer.  I think the answer can be derived from empirical evidence and reason.

Life is worth living because we can feel happy.  It is worth living because we have the potential to enjoy things like beautiful art and sunsets and the love of a wonderful romance.  It is worth living because cats are cute and philosophy is intellectually stimulating.  It is worth living because there's so much out there to explore and learn about.  It's worth living because empathy towards other humans makes me want to help them.  All these things are pleasures.  They are happiness creating things.  Life is worth living because the state of happiness is good, and we can reliably reach this state.

In a sense, we "need" to be happy.  It is the depressed person who feels no happiness who decides that they would rather die than continue living in suffering.

Thus, to me, the only real need -is- happiness.  All other "needs" are merely a means to that end.  Not the short term happiness of a drug hit, but the long term, the higher happiness of feeling that I've lived a meaningful life and reached my full potential as a human being.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[DL: "Self-Actualization is by no means necessary for survival." 

Indeed. The assertion of "real need" gets fuzzier as move up the hierarchy. 

DL: "... we choose to exist, and can choose to not exist." 

I don't think so. The rational mind cannot get there from here. Only the tortured soul or tortured body could lead to such a choice. And the legitimate hope of a better tomorrow is sufficient argument against non-existence. (As you state later when you say "Life is worth living because we can feel happy.")

DL: "Why should a life of nothing but torture, not be worth living?"

Your answered that yourself when you said, "Life is worth living because we can feel happy." Keeping in mind that happiness is spiritual, we presume that "nothing but torture" implies no hope of happiness either physically or emotionally. 

DL: "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs could easily be called Maslow's Hierarchy of Pleasures."

No, because the flu vaccination is still no pleasure even when it is really needed. 

DL: "I think the answer can be derived from empirical evidence and reason."

Amen. I think I said earlier, "The big question is 'what is actually good for us?' or 'what are the needs that are real for every living person?'. And I think that these are not arbitrary, but rather derived from empirical evidence and reason."

DL: "Life is worth living because the state of happiness is good, and we can reliably reach this state."

Happiness is a spiritual quality. A gang member may feel happy about shooting someone in a competing gang. It is not a reliable guide to what is good. Happiness can be trained by reward and punishment, by celebration and penalty, by a smile or a touch. Someone who is raised to feel good about doing good will feel differently than someone raised to feel good about doing things most of us consider bad. 

So we really need to decide what is good for us before we can determine what we ought to feel happy about.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[DL: "But empathy is a good mental state.  So would be love for all humanity.  These things all fall under my broad definition of happiness."

Whoa! That's a stretch. Empathy with suffering is suffering. From that suffering we attempt to alleviate the suffering of someone else as if it were our own. That is a good thing, of course. But empathy is not a happy or pleasurable mental state, but rather something we endure for a better good for both. 

And, yes, I almost said so that both may be happier. But the Samaritan could have retained his current happiness by suppressing his empathy, like the priest and the Levite did. In that case we would call him the "Happy Samaritan", but he would not be the "Good Samaritan". 

Empathy with suffering is suffering. But it is a good suffering because it seeks to alleviate the suffering of others. 

Happiness is a good thing, for sure, except when it is a bad thing. It would be a bad thing when it is chosen over empathy. Therefore, the proper and more reliable goal of ethics is to improve good for everyone. 

The Good Samaritan saw a man robbed and beaten by the side of the road. He treated his wounds and helped him to a hotel to rest, and promised the innkeeper to cover any additional expenses on his way back. 

Having done this, we would hope the Samaritan felt some satisfaction in his heart at having done a good thing for someone else. That would be a good happiness. 

DL: "Normal people given the wrong set of beliefs, in the wrong upbringing, and in the wrong circumstances, can do tremendous evil while thinking that they are doing the right thing."

Indeed. So do we fix this by teaching them "a better way" or by teaching them "a happier way"? 

We would like to believe that a "better" way will be a "happier" way in the long run. But it may require considerable suffering and self-sacrifice to make things better. Hey, a fellow could get crucified, for Good's sake. 

DL: "I suppose you'd also criticize Jesus for forgiving sins then?"

Spoiler alert, she puts several bullets in the guy who conned her. In the last scene, she steals another lady's gold lighter in a restaurant. In "House of Games", she loses her conscience. Mamet's "Oleanna" is another very strange morality play movie. It's like act 1 and act 2 are on two different planets. 

DL: "Assuming that the ice age creates a limited resource situation, arable land is better off being used to create plant food than it is to create livestock."

But first comes the ice fishing. 

DL: "Your still missing the fundamental point here, which is that we need some way to classify the moral value of a species or organism.  The easiest way to do so would be to compare the relative level of sentience."

What is the utility of that perspective? To whom is it useful?

DL: "Morality is in many ways, the sum of all cares in the universe.  If no subjects existed, there would be no need for morality.  It is strictly because subjects exist that morality is relevant."

So the subject is any self-aware being, capable of happiness and suffering, in the same or similar fashion as we are. So any animal would be off-limits for food. Eggs and milk should be okay though, because the products are not sentient. 

And we should morally seek the happiness of all beings that experience a subjective life, just as we seek our own happiness. 

So what do we feed the lions and tigers?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jeremy Lauer is a researcher at WHO-CHOICE, a project of the World Health Organization to encourage cost-effectiveness via both research and communication with policy-makers Rob Wiblin and I sat down to interview Jeremy and learn about WHO-CHOICE, a potentially promising career path for 80,000 Hours members interested in promoting cost-effectiveness research - one of our high priority causes to investigate.

Jeremy’s main points were:

<ul>
<li>WHO-CHOICE is about giving countries the tools needed to establish priorities in the health sector and make good, high-impact-for-money policy.</li>
<li>The landscape of global public health is starting to shift to a time where, more and more, “best buys” and “magic-bullet solutions” such as vaccines are fully funded. This is exciting because it means people are getting important treatments, but it is also daunting because the next generation of interventions will involve more complex technical work and clearer communication with the public.</li>
<li>If you have a strong economics background, are quantitatively minded, and also have interests in epidemiology, biostatistics, or computer programming, a career at WHO-CHOICE or a similar organization could be rewarding and impactful.</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Here are the excerpts from the interview:

<b>What is WHO-CHOICE?</b>

WHO-CHOICE is a program in the World Health Organization that helps countries decide priorities and figure out what they should be doing based on considerations of impact and cost-effectiveness. While other tools might be available to them to tell them how to do things, WHO-CHOICE is unique in this focus on establishing priorities.

<P>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What’s your methodology for determining cost-effectiveness?</b>

Well, first I’d like to clarify that we don’t look just at interventions that are considered cost-effective, but we try to include any activities that may be considered policy-relevant: either because they’re highly cost-effective or the opposite. What we do is we get a list of things we’d like to look at that include best practices developed by WHO programs and then add to it a list of things we feel we’d like to analyze – usually things that have tremendous upside if they turn out right, for example, vaccines. We then begin to solicit the opinions of experts.

This kind of analysis usually involves epidemiological and clinical evidence of impact, oriented by clinical trials. We want to know what the impact on the population of interest is when you give a certain population a certain technology. What is the impact on a disease parameter that is of interest to us? Does it reduce fatality rates / disease rates / remission rates? This gives our estimate of effectiveness. For cost, we add the costs of administration, training, and programme elements to the cost of operations as determined from best practice guidelines.

Right now it’s exciting because WHO-CHOICE is working with a number of world-class disease modellers that are perhaps the best in the world. It could be a real coup to bring all this expertise together and demonstrate with the best available scientific evidence that there’s a couple of interventions that are the best buys in the health sector.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What has been your most interesting or significant results so far?</b>

It’s hard to cherry-pick outstanding results. WHO-CHOICE isn’t trying to astound people, but provide basic information about bread-and-butter interventions and orient people toward more effective interventions. However, there are a number of cases from my personal work that do stand out to me. First, we found that comprehensive cancer care that involves a full spectrum of prevention, detection, and treatment actually can be cost-effective. In fact, packaging these interventions together in one program is nearly cost-effective as just the most cost-effective part of the group. This is valuable information for considering programs because ethical, medical, and social considerations often prevent splitting up the spectrum of care, so its good to have an economic argument that confirms this practice.

Another example is that in 2005, we published an analysis that implicitly determined the price at which an HPV vaccine could be sold and compete with current screening and prevention programs in terms of cost effectiveness. It subsequently turned out that the price negotiated by the procurement agencies with the vaccine manufacturers for the HPV vaccine – a much lower price than the prevailing market price – was surprisingly close to the one suggested by WHO-led research. This leads me to suspect that we had an impact on these discussions, though it’s difficult to know for sure and many other factors could equally have pointed in the same direction.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What have you found that has changed over the past ten years?</b>

Lots has changed with technological and operational progress. For example, HIV treatment has changed a lot – it previously was all about school-based education, condom distribution, and reaching out to high-risk groups. But now we have cheap and affordable treatment programs, and this is one example where treatment becomes prevention because if you get the viral load of HIV-positive people down low enough, through effective treatment, they cease to be as infective.

Malaria is another place where the game has changed a lot. We’ve seen a massive increase in the use of bed nets with both high coverage (the amount of households with bednets) and high usage (the amount of people actually sleeping under bednets). Ten years ago, this coverage was basically zero in most areas. Furthermore, there’s a malaria vaccine coming out that’s currently in phase three clinical trials.

However, we’re shifting away from an era of “magic bullets”, i.e. the model of disease elimination by single-dose vaccines conferring lifelong immunity. The HPV vaccine and the malaria vaccine won’t provide lifelong immunity. Much of the ‘low-hanging fruit’ and quick fixes are gone, so the easy victories in global public health might be over. We seem to be heading now to the next frontier of progress, one that involves more complex methods and doesn’t have any magic bullets. But the huge progress that is possible to make at this next stage, in cancers and cardiovascular disease and a whole host of non-communicable diseases, not to mention the unfinished battle against HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, this still could be an exciting message if it were conveyed effectively.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Malaria is of particular interest to Giving What We Can because we promote the Against Malaria Foundation so highly. But why does malaria treatment need to be promoted so heavily? Is there a funding gap?</b>

With the global financial crisis, there has been more competition for resources and international donor funds for malaria have stabilized and slightly tailed off. Furthermore, trends and fashions in global health have moved on, and malaria is seen as maybe having had its day in the sun so it needs to move over and make room for other challenges.

Billionaires and sometimes also donor agencies like funding magic bullets because they are game changers – it’s a nice thing to say you’ve done. But we need to change the paradigm from this kind of thinking to a more science-based, rationality-based, understandable, effectively communicated paradigm. We, as researchers, need to get our heads out of our books and tools and communicate these messages more effectively to decision-makers. A disease shouldn’t need a compelling spokesperson, but rather be defended by scientific rationale with strong evidentiary consensus.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>How did you end up working at WHO-CHOICE?</b>

I actually landed at WHO-CHOICE by chance. I initially was studying for a masters in pure economics, but I didn’t feel at home in the economics field. I was interested in working somewhere where I could apply my skills and was in the DC area with lots of medical groups, so I found it natural to apply my quantitative interests and skills as a technical writer in medicine, writing up case histories as research articles. I then came to work at WHO as an editor in the office of publications. This was in 1995 when WHO had a large Office of Publications with 5 technical editors, and they were with one exception all trained as scientists.

Over time, though, WHO switched from a doctor-focused organization dominated by a medicalized paradigm of thinking to a more broadly policy-focused group, looking more critically and analytically at economics, epidemiology and statistics. I was interested in the idea that the social sciences and related fields have a key role, so made a transfer to work in that area. I was then immediately placed with other economists, doing what I’m doing now. I then did a PhD at a leading Dutch university and major WHO collaborator. In the Netherlands, a doctorate is a pure research degree, so I could do it essentially on the basis of publications, mostly just by writing up my WHO work.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What advice would you offer other people who want to work in this area?</b>

If someone were to plan for a career at WHO-CHOICE, they should have an economics background and be quantitatively minded. It also would be good if they could demonstrate interest in the public health sphere, epidemiology, biostatistics, or maybe computer programming. It’s good to have a PhD, but you also need real world experience. Typically people are public health specialists, but not necessarily someone with a medical degree as first degree.

If a person has all these things, it is easy to make a case for hiring them. Having said that, WHO is currently hiring externally only on a limited basis because of funding shortfalls and internal reorganization.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What are the benefits to working at WHO-CHOICE?</b>

It’s very motivating to be doing something you consider important. I just think I couldn’t be as happy in the private sector, especially not after having tasted the excitement and value of the WHO. However you may criticise it as a ‘bureaucracy’, the WHO has great people doing great work, some of the best I’ve seen, and for the right kind of person that combination allows you to benefit personally from the exposure.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This sounds like value analysis applied to the range of diseases in a population, using a range of known cures. 

It would seem to me to be more relevant to the developed world rather than the undeveloped world where it is all too clear what are the maladies that need attention. Indeed following the techniques described is more likely to lead to 'analysis paralysis' in the undeveloped world. I am not surprised, therefore, that philanthropists fight shy of these techniques and go for the self-evident and quick fix.

The dichotomy should be between the situation where it is all too clear what needs to be done and the alternative situation where there are a number of competing needs of similar urgency. In the former case, just get on with it. In the latter case one needs a tool to assess where application will give the best result.

How does one define the best result? Reduction in death rate? Prolongation of years of life? Improvement in labour productivity? These are interesting questions not raised in the interview. One further asks who is best able to make these judgements, the economist (such as the interviewee) or the medical doctor? Indeed are they possible to make at all on a rational basis, or rather does one have to make a 'gut' judgement as to which to focus on and just get on and do it?

This program is funded by WHO, which in turn is funded by nation states which means in the end by you and me. And because the West is the main donor that especially means the US and Europe. There are questions on how this funding is put to use and the efficiency of the WHO. These questions are as important as the methodology for deciding where to invest. I wonder what proportion of the funding is spent directly on drugs and what proportion on bureaucratic and organisational overheads? The total budget is huge -- $4000 million for 2013 -- and growing, having doubled in the last 10 years. Over 30% is spent at Headquarters rather than in the locations where help is given. Isn't this top-heavy? If you were a donor, would you be happy with this?

Clearly the answer is a big 'NO' and, as the WHO admit, there is a lot to be done to clean house and refocus.

The interview was only able to scratch the surface of what is a hugely interesting and challenging problem.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Fred, Thank you for the comments. However, I wasn't aware that everydayutilitarian had picked up my interview, and I stumbled across this by chance...

Fred, you mention 'value analysis': well, not really. It's value-for-money analysis, i.e. a comparison of a measure of value (health gain) and the costs associated to the activities required to achieve that gain. It's usual name is cost-effectiveness analysis.

You state that this sort of analysis is more relevant to developed countries because the problems in developing countries are 'all too clear'. However, the question here is What's the best way to spend money in the health sector? In fact, this question is even more relevant in developing countries for the simple reason that waste in the worst-off countries is measured in lives lost and human suffering. Most of your argument is based on the concept of impact: i.e. simple measures of effectiveness. But that's not enough of a criterion to set priorities and avoid waste and inefficiency; a measure of efficiency is also required. In fact, in many settings around the world, waste and inefficiency are the unfortunate norm.

You asked about how to measure 'the best result': in practice we use a composite health measure that compares fatal outcomes and non-fatal outcomes, allowing both kinds of effect to be measured. These measures are not 'judgements' made by an individual or group of professionals but are measurements based on the best available scientific evidence.

Finally, you mention WHO's budget and sources of its financing. WHO receives many of it's funds from non-governmental sources. Only about 20% of WHO's budget comes from treaty obligations provided by member states.

And the figure you quote is wrong: the WHO Programme Budget for the two-year period 2012-2013 is US$ 3959, less than half of what you state (as being for a two-year period). Finally, the 'budget' does not equate to actual income: the budget is an envelope within which fund-raising can occur for purposes agreed with member states. It does not mean 'money in the bank' for WHO.

You wonder what proportion of WHO's funds are spent on drugs vs bureaucratic and organizational overheads: unfortunately that's the wrong question. Whereas the WHO Constitution defines 26 functions for the Organization only 2 of them involve implementing health services, and these two are in the context of 1) disasters and 2) the UN administered territories in Palestine. In other words, WHO's mandate is not primarily about buying and delivering medicines or other health care services to populations. Have a look at the Constitution to see what the Organization was actually founded to do. 

Consequently, your dichotomy between 'headquarters' and 'locations where help is given' tends to miss the whole point of a directing and guiding agency in international health policy. 

Finally, WHO reform is not about 'cleaning house and refocusing': it's about how to make WHO fit for purpose in a world that has substantially moved on since 1949 when the agency was created. Moreover, WHO has always been reforming; if it hadn't been, it simply wouldn't have lasted this long. The idea that WHO (or UN) reform is 'new' is a common one but it just ignores history.]]></wp:comment_content>

An interesting way to <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/variable-pricing">use variable pricing to allow trade-offs between time and money</a>:  "Mary puts up three signs on the side of the truck: $2, $3, and $5. As people come for pizza she asks them to make three lines, one for each sign, based on how much they want to pay. [...] The $2 line is long[. ...] Some people would rather have pizza sooner than money and wait in the $3 line. [...] Mary makes more money, the people who can afford to pay less get cheaper pizza, and the people in a hurry now have an option to trade off time and money."

When saying there's "no evidence" for something, keep in mind that there are actually <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/08/doctor-there-ar.html">two kinds of "no evidence"</a> -- either no evidence has turned up despite looking really hard with the right methods or no evidence has come up yet because no one has bothered to look.  Only the first one is necessarily damning to a hypothesis.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrVlq2AgwyA">The Kaye effect</a> is pretty cool: "They have made a video of leaping shampoo, in which they explain the so-called Kaye effect.  Kaye in Nature magazine in 1963 wrote 'I can offer no explanation for this behaviour.'  At high-speed recording of 1000 frames per second the following observations were made in 300ms interval: 1) a heap is formed, 2) a streamer ejects, 3) the outgoing jet rises, 4) hits the incoming jet, 5) ends the Kaye effect."

Cal Newport writes about how you can find pretty amazing-sounding accomplishments by <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/08/21/do-you-want-to-succeed-in-college-admissions-finish-something/">just doing something interesting and follow through</a>.

If you have a hard problem, one way to solve it is to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/7t2/hard_problem_hack_away_at_the_edges/">hack away at the edges</a>, working on subproblems until something comes up.

<a href="http://countinganimals.com/factory-farming-and-the-price-of-meat/">Factory farming doesn't actually reduce the price of meat</a>.  While factory farming does reduce the cost it takes to produce meat, producers are keeping the extra savings as profit and not reducing prices.

From the department of audacious philanthropy, this family <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/opinion/24kristof.html?_r=2&">sold their house and donated half of the proceeds</a> and bought a smaller house.

The Battle of Hoth proves that both the Rebels and the Empire are <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/battle-of-hoth/">complete, total idiots when it comes to military strategy</a>.

<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/16/google-correlate-does-not-imply-google-causation/">Google Correlate Does Not Imply Google Causation</a>. Hilarity + statistics.

<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/09/opinion/bors-millenial-comic-strip/index.html?hpt=op_t1">Can We Stop Worrying About Millennials Yet?</a>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I will just comment on the article 'Factory farming doesn't actually reduce the price of meat". This is rubbish as is most stuff written by 'animal lovers'.

The market controls the price of meat. The price fluctuates according to supply and demand, both in the local market and the International market. 

When the costs are reduced the price goes down. Competition sees to that, and there are thousands of pig farmers in dozens of countries. Shortages/surpluses of meat push the International price around. On this is superimposed local variations due to the well-known 'pig cycle'.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions-octember-edition/">"New Years Resolutions: Octember Edition"</a></i>

Another month, another opportunity to review how my life is going and make sure I'm doing everything I want to do, the way I want to do it.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Did October Go?</h2>
<b>Points:</b> My goal was to score 11400 "daypoints" over the month according to my <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/resolutions-update-june-edition/">scoring system</a> where different habits of mine are assigned different point values for each day.  I earned 11422.5 points (100.1%), which means I succeeded, but barely.  Note that 1-6 Oct was not included because I was late to start my monthly review and 16-20 Oct was not included because I was on vacation.

<b>Time on task:</b> This month I spent an average of 10.7 hours a day working (a 74.9 hour work week), which is down from September's 81.5 hour work week, but up from August's 69.5 hour work week.  Note that work includes everything I do that's not sleep, reading, eating, exercising, showering, getting dressed, hanging out with friends/family, video games, spacing out, watching TV, and other commonsense things.

<b>Time with friends/family:</b> I spent an average of 3.3 hours a day with friends/family.

<b>Exercise:</b> I spent an average of 64.5 minutes a day <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/logs/">doing exercise</a>, mostly <a href="http://www.stronglifts.com/">Stronglifts</a> and some running.  I improved my lifts (boosted my Squat from 135lbs to 155lbs, Bench from 75lbs to 80lbs, and Deadlift from 195lbs to 215lbs) and my running distance (from 4.5mi to 5.2mi).

<b>Other Goals:</b> I met my goals for sleeping 75% of the time, breakfast 90% of the time, lunch 90%, dinner 50%, not snacking 45%, cleanliness 93%, and order 88%.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Is New for November?</h2>
Actually, I'm going to take what I did for October and do it over again, with the same goals and scoring system.  I aim to collect 16200 points.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You may (hopefully) have noticed that this blog has died out again.  Maybe you've even come to miss it.  After all, in past years, I've spent November doing <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> for my blog (see <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/the-nanowrimo-reflection">2011</a> and <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/the-nanowrimo-2012-reflection">2012</a>), but this year I've done nothing blog-wise.

So what have I been doing, behind the scenes, while not blogging?  I'll tell you!<!--more-->

<b>I've been working on applying to jobs.</b>  I'm no longer considering law school or graduate school at the moment and focusing instead on applying to good ol' fashioned jobs.  ...in market research and web development.  So far I'm 0 offers for 1 sent application.

<b>I've been spending a significant amount of time learning programming</a></b>, going through textbooks and <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a> to learn jQuery and Ruby on Rails.  I also signed-up for <a href="https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-002/class/index">an online class to learn R</a>, the statistics package.  I hope to sharpen these skills to get those aforementioned jobs I just talked about.

<b>I've been working on the EA Projects Group</b> with <a href="http://ozziegooen.com/">Ozzie Gooen</a>.  This is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/203204829847175/">a group</a> dedicated to coordinating the work of online volunteers toward completing programming and research projects to further the effective altruist movement.  I'm working on a few of the programming apps myself while providing project management for the team.  We're currently working on branding ourselves and hope to have a new name soon.

<b>I've been volunteering for some effective altruist orgs</b>, like <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>, <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org">Effective Animal Activism</a> (soon to be renamed "Animal Charity Evaluators"), and <a href="http://www.effectivefundrasing.net">Effective Fundraising</a>.  I'm also working on a few things for <a href="http://www.80000hours.org">80000 Hours</a>.

<b>I started <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1024">a debate</a> with Alonzo Fyfe of <a href="http://desirism.wikia.com/wiki/Desirism">Desirism</a> and <a href="http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/">Atheist Ethicist</a> fame.</b>  The topic is whether Alonzo Fyfe's desirism or <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-does-utilitarianism-look-like-in-practice/">my two-level utilitarianism</a> is the better theory of utilitarianism.

<b>I competed in the <a href="http://www.acmamootcourt.org">Moot Court</a> Saginaw Valley Regional.</b>  My partner and I placed eighth which was respectable, but not quite as good as I had wanted and not good enough to qualify for Nationals like we did last year.  My eight years of law-related education are now officially over.

<b>I competed in my first official race</b> -- the <a href="http://www.thanksgivingdayrace.com/">Cincinnati Thanksgiving Day 10K</a>.  I've never run 10K before, so I was happy enough to do the entire thing without stopping, completing the 6.2 miles in 65 minutes and 59 seconds.  I placed 7409th out of some 17,000 people and I was outraced by a seven year-old kid.

<b>I've been working on quite a few other things</b>, like my senior research, being the Recruitment Chair of <a href="http://denisonbeta.com/">my fraternity</a>, being a stats tutor, and being a part of <a href="https://orgsync.com/custom_pages/10460/show/8585">Denison Venture Philanthropy</a> and <a href="http://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/service-opportunities/dca">Denison Community Association</a>.

<b>I've been hanging out with friends and family.</b>  I also went and visited my girlfriend for a few days.  It is Thanksgiving, after all.

I do <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-i-am-productive/">weekly reviews</a> to make sure that I'm prioritizing my daily tasks well.  I do <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/category/resolutions/">monthly reviews</a> to track my adherence to important habits.  However, now I'd like to do something still a bit new -- a <i>six-month</i> review that basically checks to make sure everything is going to plan from an even higher, more abstract level of review.<!--more-->


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Did The Last Six Months Go?</h2>
Back in May, I wrote <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-strategic-plan/">"My Strategic Plan"</a> to outline my first six-month review where I enumerated some projects I wanted to focus on.  Here's how I've been doing on them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Thinking Through Complex Issues</h4>
<b>"What should I do when I graduate?"</b>  I've been spending a lot of time on this one, writing three essays on career choice: <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-plan/">"My Careers Plan"</a>, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/i-now-have-approximately-five-career-categories/">"I Now Have Approximately Five Career Categories"</a>, and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/comparing-across-my-five-career-categories/">"Comparing Across My Five Career Categories"</a>.  I also summarized some links on career choice in <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/sunday-links-17-altruistic-careers-advice-edition/">"Sunday Links #17: Altruistic Careers Advice Edition"</a>.  Lastly, I interviewed three people on careers: <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/interview-with-jon-behar/">Jon Behar</a>, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-conversation-with-holden-karnofsky/">Holden Karnofsky</a>, and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-conversation-with-satvik-beri/">Satvik Beri</a>.

<b>"What normative framework should I choose?"</b> I wrote a lengthy <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/a-meta-ethics-faq/">essay on meta-ethics</a>.  Soon, I plan on writing a similar "FAQ"-style essay for why I picked utilitarianism sometime soon.

<b>"What would someone acting out utilitarianism in their everyday life look like?"</b>  I've added to this in <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-does-utilitarianism-look-like-in-practice/">"What Does Utilitarianism Look Like in Practice?"</a>.  Again, I think the "Utilitarianism FAQ" is a good next step here.

<b>"How, if at all, can utilitarianism be presented as a robust moral theory?"</b> I haven't done any work on this, but I hope to in the upcoming "Utilitarianism FAQ".

<b>"What causes should a utilitarian focus on?"</b>  I haven't done any work on this either, but when I hope to write on this very shortly when I decide where I want to donate my money in December.  I probably should also re-evaluate how I'm spending my time with regard to which effective altruist projects I focus on soon too.

<b>"How, if at all, should I change my lifestyle?"</b> Beyond <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/category/resolutions/">my monthly reviews</a>, I haven't done any additional work on this.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Blogging, Generally</h4>
I do like blogging <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-i-blog/">for a variety of reasons</a>, but I do need to do some more work to decide how much time I should sink into it, if any.  For example, is a marginal hour spent blogging more important than a marginal hour spent volunteering for an EA org or a marginal hour spent learning more programming?

Another suspicion I have is audience.  I suspect that writing essays here is important, but it's potentially more important to write essays that would go on <a href="http://www.lesswrong.com">LessWrong</a> or a blog of an effective altruist organization, for better visibility.

I could spent an unlimited amount of time on any of these three tasks (blogging, volunteering, programming), so deciding how to allocate my time between these tasks is an important thing to focus on.  Right now, I don't have any answers on this, but I intend to do a more thorough review sometime soon.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Volunteering for Like-Minded Communities</h4>
I've recently been volunteering for <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net">Effective Fundraising</a> (EF), <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> (GWWC), and <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org">Effective Animal Activism</a> (EAA).  I'm happy with my current engagement with EF (very low-time commitment editing and reviewing), but feel like I ought to put more time into EAA (to accomplish the same amount of work on a faster time-table) and/or put more time into GWWC (to actually accomplish work).  I also could consider volunteering for more organizations, like <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org">The Life You Can Save</a> (TLYCS).

There is a bit of a tension here because on one hand it makes sense to focus narrowly on the organization I think I can produce the most impact with and do better work there but on the other hand organizations take awhile to review your work and get back to you, so there's time to work for multiple organizations if you can alternate correctly.  I need to do more work here too in order to decide whether to scale-down or scale-up and which organizations to focus on.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Making Denison University a Better Place</h4>
I also resolved to work on making Denison a better place (1) for the non-utilitarian sake of it, (2) to gain experience that I can use to apply utilitarian ends, and (3) for résumé boosting.

<b>Denison Venture Philanthropy:</b> <a href="http://www.denison.edu/campuslife/servicelearning/venture_philanthropy_club.html">DVP</a> (previously called "Venture Philanthropy Club") is a grant-making college organization that gives a $10K grant out each year and then volunteers to implement that grant.  I didn't actually do all that much important work here.  We did end up successfully navigating our fall semester and picking our sixth grantee.  Now as I enter into the Spring Semester I want to work on stepping away from the organization and ensuring it transitions smoothly to the next generation of leadership.

<b>Beta Theta Pi:</b> I'll still be serving as the Recruitment Chair of my fraternity chapter until February 2014.  This has been a fun position with appropriate challenge, but ultimately I think I erred in taking it on and it hasn't helped further my goals nearly as much as I had hoped.  Unfortunately, it's impossible to drop it, so I will serve out the remainder of the term to the best of my ability.  I plan on no longer holding a position in Beta after my term is over, so I can focus on more important things.

<b>Moot Court:</b> Moot Court is now over, but I ended up putting a lot of time into it and it ultimately came to a more or less unsatisfactory conclusion.  I'm unsure if I erred in doing it this year since I believe it would have been important had I chosen to try for a career in law, which had been my leading option a the time I tried to do it.  However, once I decided that law wasn't right for me, Moot Court ended up becoming much less useful.

<b>Gaming Guild:</b> I had mentioned wanting to scale this down in my previous plan and I think I have done so, more or less, though it still remains a large time commitment of mine that is enjoyable, but probably should be scaled down further for reasons I will discuss later in this essay.

<b>Denison Community Association:</b> The <a href="http://www.denison.edu/campuslife/servicelearning/denison_community_associatio.html">DCA</a> the umbrella organization for all volunteering on campus.  Unlike all the other Denison activities I commented on, this is the position I look forward to scaling upwards and putting more time into.  Now that I'm focused primarially on increasing the breadth and depth of service engagements on campus, I think there's a lot of potential in learning about volunteerism on such a microcosm of campus that can potentially be applied in the real-world.  I'd like to do more with this, but I'm not quite sure what yet.

<b>Senior Research:</b> I'm doing senior research on the experience of election loss as a motivator to reduced political participation, with a particular focus on looking at how optimism moderates this effect.  I think it's unlikely that the research itself will be impactful, but I still think it's pretty good training in study methods and design so I'm excited to work on this more as well.  I should put more time into this.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Other</h4>
<b>Finding and Talking to Cool People:</b> I had mentioned that I wanted to spend more time identifying and networking with cool people, mostly within the effective altruist and rationalist movements.  I think I've definitely succeeded at this, developing a lot of relationships through my internship with Giving What We Can.  I'm pretty happy with how this is going.

<b>"Targeted Reading":</b> Despite commenting six months ago about how my reading habits were aimless and "shift more time to reading specific books and sites", I haven't actually done anything to make this happen.  I still think it's valuable to do so, so I need to renew my focus on this.

<b>De-emphasizing campus job:</b> I still took a position as a stats tutor, but I decided not to look for a 10hr/week job like I had originally thought of looking for.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Am I Spending My Time, More Particularly?</h2>
I've tracked my time a bit day-by-day, but I've never broke things down by each activity before.  So I looked at my time logs for a representative slice of time -- 25 October through 25 November -- and looked at what I've been spending my time on.

Here's the information in table form...

<img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/month-table.png" alt="month-table" width="414" height="286" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1019" />

...and graph form...

<img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/month-graph.png" alt="month-graph" width="570" height="430" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
To clarify some potentially confusing categories: "Friends+" means time spent with friends plus family and my girlfriend (this includes things like Gaming Guild), "class" is time spent actually in the classroom, "ACE" is working for Effective Animal Activism (soon to be renamed Animal Charity Evaluators or ACE), "Programming" includes learning programming languages and work on the  EA Projects Group, "Careers" is time spent looking for and applying to jobs, and "Uncat." is uncategorized; my "other" catch-all for when it (1) counted as being on-task doing something important, but (2) didn't fit in another category and (3) wasn't notable enough to deserve it's own category.

A few things stand out to me looking back on this -- I spent more time with friends and learning how to program than I expected.  I also didn't notice how large the time commitments to Moot Court and Beta were, though I do think this month was atypical for both (being the month of Moot Court competition and fraternity initiation), so that should sort out itself next month (especially now that Moot Court is over forever).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goals for the Next Six Months</h2>
<b>I need to more deeply evaluate how I should spend my time,</b> potentially looking to apply my <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/comparing-across-my-five-career-categories/">careers reasoning</a> to choosing between how to allocate time between various projects and activities.  I claim to be a full-time student but the time logs show I'm only putting 23.44 hours a week toward being a student, so I have plenty more time to do whatever I want and I ought to use it effectively.  In general, I'm looking to scale down involvement with DVP, Beta, and Gaming Guild and potentially scale up involvement with DCA, blogging, programming, volunteering, and senior research as discussed above.

<b>I need to hang out with friends and family in more intentional ways.</b>  In general, I want to spend less overall time with friends while still not sacrificing anything by making each amount of time last more.  I think I can accomplish this by choosing hang outs wisely to be the ones where I will have more substantial interaction and deciding to go to more hang outs for less amount of time each.

<b>I need a better handle on my sleep</b> as I think <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com">polyphasic sleep</a> has the potential to be promising.  However, I've been chasing it without much success recently, resulting in erratic and probably unhealthy sleep.  I need to stabilize into something, even if it doesn't offer much in sleep reduction.

<b>I need to be stricter about my diet and bulk better.</b>  Despite intending to gain weight in order to increase strength, I've been continuing to lose weight even more (a problem I know a lot of people would like to have, I'm sure).  I need to adhere to my diet more strictly in order to make sure I take in all the calories I need while staying healthy.

<b>I need to get more focused on job searching,</b> not just in the amount of opportunities I look into, but the depth I afford each opportunity.  So far I've only applied to two things and I should work on that a lot more if I want any hope of applying <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-conversation-with-satvik-beri/">Satvik's negotation tactics</a>.

<b>I need to work more on targeted reading,</b> and shift more time to reading specific books and sites and actually blog about them, both parts I’ve still had trouble with.]]></content:encoded>

Yeah, that's worth thinking about. You would get <i>much</i> higher visibility elsewhere, but some of the posts aren't worth sharing externally. For example, this one is probably too personal to go on LW. As you know, I use a static webpage for more permanent essays (rather than transitory blog posts). One reason I don't post everything on LW is that it takes longer to reply to the comments than to write the original post. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

Thanks!  <a href="www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-i-am-productive/" rel="nofollow">This stuff seems to work</a>.

~

<blockquote>For example, this one is probably too personal to go on LW.</blockquote>

Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.  But I could change my focus to write less of these kinds of things and more LW-able things.  Or do less non-blog stuff and more LW writing.

~

<blockquote>One reason I don’t post everything on LW is that it takes longer to reply to the comments than to write the original post. :)</blockquote>

I think that's an irrational reason to avoid posting to LW.  Yes post but no reply to comments is better than no post at all.]]></wp:comment_content>

				<title>Good Judgment Project, Season Three</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Think you have what it takes to make good predictions?  Since 2011, the <a href="http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/">Good Judgment Project</a> (GJP) has been making predictions on issues of international relations and foreign affairs, recently winning the IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) prediction contest.  Predictions from the GJP have been startlingly accurate, outperforming prediction markets, and exceeding even optimistic expectations.  It's run by Phillip Tetlock, the famous predictor of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691128715">"foxes and hedgehogs" fame</a>.

From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/26/good-judgment-in-forecasting-international-affairs-and-an-invitation-for-season-3/">the Monkey Cage article</a>:

<blockquote>How does the Good Judgment Project achieve such strikingly accurate results? The Project uses modern social-science methods ranging from harnessing the wisdom of crowds to prediction markets to putting together teams of forecasters. The GJP research team attributes its success to a blend of getting the right people (i.e., the “right” individual forecasters) on the bus, offering basic tutorials on inferential traps to avoid and best practices to embrace, concentrating the most talented forecasters into super teams, and constantly fine-tuning the aggregation algorithms it uses to combine individual forecasts into a collective prediction on each forecasting question. The Project’s best forecasters are typically talented and highly motivated amateurs, rather than subject matter experts.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

But the good news is that you now have a chance to get involved with GJP Season 3 if you think you're a great predictor:

<blockquote>If you enjoy world politics and appreciate a good challenge, consider joining the Good Judgment Project, which has openings right now for Season 3 forecasters. The Project will give you the opportunity to receive training, to get regular feedback on your forecasting accuracy, and to test your forecasting skills against those of some of the most accurate forecasters around. Interested? To find out more and to register, go to <a href="http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/">www.goodjudgmentproject.com</a>.</blockquote>

				<title>What I&#039;d Like For My Birthday and Christmas</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My birthday is December 11. Christmas, my December holiday of choice, is December 25. I’ve heard that some people want to get me gifts for these two holidays. If you’re one of these people, here’s a list of things I would like, in my order of preference!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>#1.) Donations to <a href="http://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a>.</b>  GiveDirectly is a new charity that will take any cash you donate it and give it directly, no strings attached, to extremely poor families in Africa.  Surprisingly, they've found that such transfers result in useful spending like buying food, investing in their homes, paying school fees, or increasing their savings.  Very few recipients use it on alcohol or tobacco.

GiveDirectly has been thoroughly vetted and is supported by <a href="http://www.givedirectly.org/evidence.php">multiple studies</a> and is currently one of the three top recommendations of <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, a very selective independent charity evaluator.  Additionally, the foundation <a href="http://www.goodventures.org">Good Ventures</a> has promised to <a href="http://www.goodventures.org/about-us/press/good-ventures-announces-5-million-in-matching-funds-for-givedirectly">match any donation to GiveDirectly</a> up to $100K, so any donation you give will be doubled!

To be honest, I already have lots of the things I need or the means to get them for myself.  I'm really excited about the opportunity to make a true difference in the world via GiveDirectly and would greatly prefer a donation here more than any other gift.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
If you don't want to donate to GiveDirectly, here are some books I really would like to get:

<b>#2.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GSZZ24">The Charisma Myth: How Anyone Can Master the Art and Science of Personal Magnetism</a> by Olivia Fox Cabane.</b>  I like receiving books and don't mind if they're used, as long as they're still legible!

#3.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307956393">Decisive: How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work</a> by Chip and Dan Heath.

#4.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JH8MHO">The Copywriter's Handbook, Third Edition: A Step-By-Step Guide To Writing Copy That Sells</a> by Robert W. Bly.

#5.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1848728859">The Science of Giving: Experimental Approaches to the Study of Charity</a> by 
Daniel M. Oppenheimer and Christopher Y. Olivol.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Last year, two readers of my blog reached out and bought me a book from my list.  I totally don't expect that, but if you do want to do this for some reason, feel free to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/contact/">contact me</a> for shipping information.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems that if we're good utilitarians and concerned about sacrificing in order to bring greater goods for others, we should spend every moment of our day agonizing over every purchase and how it could go further than others.  But this is self-destructive and will make us less effective overall, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-03-07/tradeoffs">as Julia Wise explains</a>: "I think it's good to go through a period of thinking that way.  Just like when you live in another country for a while you start being able to understand prices without converting back to your own currency, when you start thinking about all your spending in Vaccination Currency or Mosquito Net Currency it becomes habitual.  Your spending habits can't help but be affected.  I also think there's only so much grief we can carry.  I cannot go the next 70 years counting dead children on every receipt.  I would break."

<a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/10/22/theres-something-you-need-to-know-about-the-rules/">"There's Something You Need to Know About the Rules"</a>: "This suggestion seemed to bring him great unease. The instructions were telling him to write his story in the notebook, and he had clearly written his on the paper instead. He was in violation of The Rules, and this was scaring him.  I suddenly realized I had some teaching to do. It was time to share a deeper explanation of what The Rules really are, and I thought you might want to join in for the session as well. Because if you look around carefully, you will see that most of the problems of our society are based upon an incorrect understanding of these rules."

"4:33" is a piece of music by John Cage that consists entirely of silence.  It's available on iTunes.  The real question is <a href="http://whywereason.com/2011/07/29/why-youll-pay-for-silence-john-cages-433/">why would people buy it?</a>.  The answer is a tale of how we don't value things solely for what they do, but also for their history.

<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/5r6/spend_money_on_ergonomics/">It seems like it could be more worthwhile than commonly thought to spend money on improving one's ergonomics</a>.  And while we're on the topic of applied rationality, here's <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/7am/rational_home_buying/">better house buying through knowledge of heuristics and biases</a>.

<a href="www.cookingfor20.com/2013/06/18/hacker-school-soylent-recipe/">Soylent</a> is an artifical mixture of nutrients that supplies everything you need in a diet without actually requiring food.  <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/06/10/soylent-is-the-food-of-the-future-really-a-nutrition-solution/">Here's a good review from TIME</a>.

<a href="http://www.academia.edu/1093050/The_Paradox_of_Deontology_Revisited">The paradox of deontology</a>: If a certain thing is bad according to deontology, why is it not ok to do that bad thing in order to cause even more cases of that bad thing from happening?

<a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30937/famous-novelists-symbolism-their-work-and-whether-it-was-intentional">Turns out that much symbolism in many famous novels wasn't intentional.</a>  Also, novelists can be a bit rude when responding to surveys.

<a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/08/racism-by-political-party.html">Turns out that neither Democrats or Republicans are more racist than the other.</a>  Move along.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, the blog went dead again, which means it's time to revive the blog with a run-down of all the non-blog things I've been doing recently.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions-november-edition/">"New Years Resolutions: November Edition"</a></i>

Last January, I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions">outlined some New Years Resolutions</a>, and then did what I thought impossible -- used the power of blogging, precommitment, and betting to <i>actually stick to my plans</i>.  Following up <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions-november-edition/">my last report in November</a>, I present my December update, which tracks how well I did in... November.  Sorry that's a bit confusing and that this was posted so late.

But anyways...<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Did November Go?</h2>
<b>Points:</b>  My goal was to score 13440 “daypoints” over the month according to my scoring system where different habits of mine are assigned different point values for each day.  I did not score the time period between the 22nd and 27th of November as I was on vacation.   Overall, I earned 13090 points, which was 97.4% of my goal.

<b>Time on task:</b> This month I spent an average of 10.58 hours a day working (a 74.06 hour work week), which is down from October's 74.9 hour work week and September's 81.5 hour work week, which means I'm continuing to lose a bit of steam.  (Note that work includes everything I do that's not sleep, reading, eating, exercising, showering, getting dressed, hanging out with friends/family, video games, spacing out, watching TV, and other commonsense things.)

<b>Time with friends/family:</b> I spent an average of 4.2 hours a day with friends/family, which is up from 3.3 hours a day in October.

<b>Exercise:</b> I spent an average of 58.3 minutes a day <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/logs/">doing exercise</a>, mostly <a href="http://www.stronglifts.com/">Stronglifts</a> and some running (down from 64.5 minutes a day in October).  I still improved my lifts (boosted my Squat from 155lbs to 190lbs, Bench from 80lbs to 85lbs, but did not improve my Deadlift) and my running distance (from 5.2mi to 6.2mi).

<b>Other Goals:</b> I met my goals for sleeping 75% of the time, breakfast 90% of the time, lunch 90%, dinner 50%, not snacking 45%, cleanliness 93%, and order 88%.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is New for December?</h2>
I think this is going decently well, so I want to try this again for the third time over December and then make updates as warranted for my next year of New Years Resolutions.  I aim to collect 17205 points.

				<title>Where I&#039;m Giving and Why</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m really excited about the opportunity I have to use money to make the world a significantly better place.  Furthermore, it’s a core conviction of mine that living an ethical and fulfilling life requires donating as much as one can spare to the best causes.

But what are those best causes?  The only honest answer is that I don’t know.  I think I have a good grasp of where the best causes <i>aren’t</i>, but a lot more research has to be done by myself and others before I can feel confident giving anywhere.  Therefore, I’ve decided to donate very minimally and save my donations for later.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My Plan to Learn Through Giving</h2>
If anything is the core foundation of effective altruism theory, it’s that causes can differ from each other in expected impact by <i>tremendous</i> amounts.  The example of spending <a href="http://www.guidedogsofamerica.org/1/">$42K on a guide dog</a> in the developed world versus spending <a href="http://www.hollows.org.au/">$25 to cure blindness in the developing world</a> is very salient comparison to me, though <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2008/07/21/preventing-blindness/">perhaps it is not completely fair</a>.  There’s also a concern echoed by Brian Tomasik that since we’re uncertain about a lot of cause-and-effect relationships, <a href="http://utilitarian-essays.com/robustness-against-uncertainty.html">what appears to be doing good might actually be a harm!</a>  I therefore want to be pretty careful with how I donate even $1K, because that could be worth the same as millions of dollars elsewhere.

This makes it a huge priority to learn more about opportunities for doing good, whether by donating or working.  Thus, I’ve decided to spend my money and time trying to figure out how to learn more in reliable ways and I’m going to be slow to disperse money until I find ways I can reliably <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/10/obstacles-to-giving-as-consumption/">invest that money</a> in learning.  You can see the money I donate, as I donate it, on <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/donations-report/">my donations page</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What is my plan, more specifically?</h4>
My current plan is to keep a line in my budget spreadsheet that specifies how much donations I “owe”, which currently will be 20% of my total income.  Currently, I don’t have any plans to earmark these donations in any other way, and they will just remain a part of my total investments.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What About Other Opportunities?</h2>
<h4>Why not a donor-advised fund?</h4>
If I keep up the plan of saving long-term, I will eventually get a donor advised fund for tax reasons.  However, right now I am still a college student and I am not yet in a position where I need to worry about taxes.  I’m also not worried, at least in the short-term, about the traditional concern of values drift that a donor advised fund protects against.

I also think there are two compelling advantages to keeping some donatable money outside of a donor-advised fund: (a) keeping the ability to move money to projects that do not have 501(c)3 status (something I expect to run into a lot, actually) and (b) keeping the ability to save money for myself, in case I want to <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/">retire early</a> and work full-time on EA stuff.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What about GiveWell?</h4>
I have high trust and broad epistemic and methodological agreement with GiveWell.  I normally look to GiveWell’s recommendations as solid opportunities for doing good.  However, this year, the recommendations available seem to be poorer than usual.  As <a href="http://www.reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2013/12/off-cuff-thoughts-on-givewells-2013.html">Carl Shulman points out</a> and <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/12/staff-members-personal-donations/">GiveWell employees confirm</a>, this favors saving to wait for later.

However, I still find GiveDirectly to be intuitively appealing and I’m attracted to the relative simplicity of the model and using GiveDirectly as a way of spreading cost-effectiveness.  Therefore, while I haven’t personally put any money toward GiveDirectly, I’ve <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-id-like-for-my-birthday-and-christmas/">asked for donations to GiveDirectly for my birthday and Christmas</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What about GiveWell Labs?</h4>
I thus have strongly considered donating to GiveWell directly to help them, and have done so in the past.  However, as of <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2012/06/28/givewell-and-good-ventures/">their recent partnership with Good Ventures</a>, I believe them to now have all the funds they need to operate.  GiveWell wishes to have <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/20/update-on-givewells-funding-needs/">additional donations for diversification purposes</a>, so as to <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/09/17/balancing-support-from-good-ventures-vs-individuals/">maintain their independence from Good Ventures</a>.

However, I personally don’t find this to be a compelling and urgent need.  If the situation were that Good Ventures were withdrawing and GiveWell was going to scale back significantly, I would probably donate (depending on the reason for Good Ventures) splitting.  But right now, I think there are more urgent needs and therefore I consider GiveWell to have no “room for more funding”.  I intend to write more about this.

Perhaps one can think of moving money to GiveWell Labs <a href="http://www.reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2013/12/donor-advised-fund-using-future.html">as a donation to Good Ventures’s future funding</a>, increasing the amount of money that is moved to future recommendations by GiveWell.  This could be compelling given my broad trust about GiveWell, but right now I think it’s generally more robust to wait and see what other opportunities I find, since (a) there’s a risk that I might stop trusting Good Ventures / GiveWell, (b) I might run into a better funding opportunity that Good Ventures / GiveWell is not in a position to also fund, and (c) I don’t yet get tax benefits on moving donations out of my investment account.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Are there any other groups working on EA learning that you like?</h4>
I’m also watching closely the work of other organizations, like the <a href="http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Centre for Effective Altruism</a> (CEA), the <a href="http://intelligence.org/">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> (MIRI), the <a href="http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">Future of Humanity Institute</a> (FHI), <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org">Effective Animal Activism</a> (EAA), and Brian Tomasik’s upcoming Foundational Research Institute (FRI).  All of these organizations seem focused on learning in potentially useful ways and I could see myself moving significant amounts of money to them.

Unfortunately, I do not yet have enough detail on what these organizations are doing to learn and whether they are following methodologies for learning I would endorse and therefore I’m not quite confident enough to give large sums of money to these organizations.  Spending more time figuring out what these organizations are doing and spending more time figuring out what methodologies for learning I would endorse are top priorities for me going forward.  Some aspects I’m concerned about is whether good monitoring and evaluation procedures are in place to make sure progress is made.  It’s very easy to do things and not learn about them and end up spinning in circles, especially with theoretical work.

But I’m excited about 80,000 Hours’s <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/246-our-progress-dec-2012-may-2013">recent impact report</a>, Giving What We Can’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/peterhurford.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjEyNmI1Y2ZhMmUwYjk2ODk">plan to focus on monitoring and evaluation for their pledgees</a>, and <a href="http://intelligence.org/2013/04/13/miris-strategy-for-2013/">MIRI’s commitment</a> to <a href="http://intelligence.org/2013/04/04/the-lean-nonprofit/">“lean non-profit” methodologies</a>.  I look forward to following more development in these areas and I plan on writing more about this.

I also intend to spend a substantial amount of time looking for projects that I myself can take on to both perform and fund necessary expenses out of my donation account.  I’ve created an organization with Ozzie Gooen, <a href="http://www.dotimpact.im">.impact</a>, that will allow us to both do this.  I’m not yet sure if .impact will produce more promising opportunities in research or other areas than these other organizations, but I look forward to further exploration to see what I can find.  .impact has not fully launched yet, and I expect to write a lot more about it later.

<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-im-giving-and-why/">Earlier I mentioned</a> that my current plan for doing good via donations is to keep a line in my budget spreadsheet that specifies how much donations I “owe”, which currently will be 20% of my total income.

After cross-posting <a href="http://www.effective-altruism.com/where-im-giving-and-why-peter-hurford/">"Where I'm Giving and Why" on the Effective Altruism blog</a>, commenter Brad <a href="http://www.effective-altruism.com/where-im-giving-and-why-peter-hurford/#comment-1175928963">asked me</a> "Given all the uncertainties, do you honestly think that in 10 years' time the choice of which charity(ies) to fund will be significantly clearer than it is today?"

My straightforward answer is yes.  In fact, I see good giving opportunities improving <i>right now</i> and I expect to be donating large chunks again within a year, not within ten.  But I wanted to take this comment seriously and give it a detailed response, since I think the case for saving is non-obvious and counter-intuitive.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>I'm Not Worried Too Much About Uncertainty, Per Se</h2>
Brad <a href="http://www.effective-altruism.com/where-im-giving-and-why-peter-hurford/#comment-1175928963">continues in his comment</a>, worried that I'm overly concerned about uncertainty:

<blockquote>There will always be the possibility that there's some as-yet undiscovered opportunity that's better than the ones available. You could almost turn this sentence from your post: "It’s very easy to do things and not learn about them and end up spinning in circles, especially with theoretical work." into this sentence: "It's very easy to learn about things and not do anything, and end up spinning in circles, especially with theoretical work."

[...] I'm probably painting this much more extremely than you're viewing it, but I'm sceptical that there will ever be universal agreement on the "best" causes or the "best" charities, and at some point you may want to embrace imperfection and perhaps settle for not literally doing the most good but the most good given the information currently available.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I think <a href="http://www.effective-altruism.com/where-im-giving-and-why-peter-hurford/#comment-1176206686">Michael Dickens gave a good initial reply in the comments section</a>, but more needs to be said because I do agree a lot with Brad here.  First, I am very concerned about people working too much on abstract or overly meta actions and not actually doing anything -- it's an easy trap to get caught in, and one I definitely seek to avoid.  Second, I definitely am aiming to do the most good given the information currently available.

However, my fundamental conclusion is <b>the best thing to do given the information currently available is to acquire more information</b>.  I mentioned this in the "Value of Information, Exploring, and Exploiting" subsection of <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">"Why I'm Skeptical About Unproven Causes (and You Should Be Too)"</a> (see also <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-ive-changed-my-mind-on-my-approach-to-speculative-causes/">"Where I've Changed My Mind on My Approach to Speculative Causes"</a>):

<blockquote>Perhaps one could look to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">“explore-exploit model”</a>, or the idea that we achieve the best outcome when we spend a lot of time exploring first (learning more about how to achieve better outcomes) before exploiting (focusing resources on achieving the best outcome we can). Therefore, whenever we have an opportunity to “explore” further or learn more about what causes have high impact, we should take it.</blockquote>

To draw this out more explicitly, I'd argue that (a) it's very likely there are much better giving opportunities out there than what we have currently identified and (b) it's likely that further learning can better identify these giving opportunities.  While we can save lives now (exploiting), if we prioritize learning (exploring) we can find even better opportunities to save many more lives over the long-run.  Brad is concerned that the cost of waiting is that "real people whose lives could be helped by your donations are not getting that aid", but the fact is that the cost of acting now is that less people end up aided overall, which is very unfortunate.

Given this, I have taken the strategy of slowly funding opportunities to learn in a meta-meta stroke of "learning how to learn".  While I am sympathetic to concerns that this might be too "meta" and that I'm not taking myself too seriously, I don't think concerns that I'm looking for 100% certainty is an issue, because I'm not.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Good Opportunities Are Just on the Horizon</h2>
Looking just at classic <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, it seems that there <a href="http://www.reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2013/12/off-cuff-thoughts-on-givewells-2013.html">has been a blip downward in expected utility</a> from giving to <a href="www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell's top charities</a> due to <a href="againstmalaria.com">the Against Malaria Foundation</a> running <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/">out of room for more funding</a> temporarily.  However, lots of people expect this to be a temporary problem -- GiveWell expects the issue to be resolved, AMF <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/Distributionupdate28Nov2013.aspx">doesn't see it as a large problem</a>, and Giving What We Can is <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-12-12/why-we-continue-to-recommend-the-against-malaria-foundation">continuing to recommend AMF to its donors</a> for the time being.  For fans of AMF, it looks like there's only going to be a delay of a few months, not a decade.

I'm also excited for other opportunities, like I mentioned earlier.  <a href="http://www.givewell.org/givewell-labs">GiveWell Labs</a> is chugging along, and <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/01/givewells-top-charities-for-giving-season-2013/comment-page-1/#comment-790596">expects to make good recommendations within a few years</a>.  In <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-09-08/a-conversation-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell-part-ii">an interview between Giving What We Can and Holden Karnofsky</a> (which I had the fun of helping to transcribe!), Holden says that he does think "there is a 50% or higher chance that GiveWell will find something twice as high impact as malaria within the next, say, five years".
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What about other than GiveWell?</h4>
I also mentioned some other organizations -- like the <a href="http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Centre for Effective Altruism</a> (CEA), the <a href="http://intelligence.org/">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> (MIRI), the <a href="http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">Future of Humanity Institute</a> (FHI), <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org">Effective Animal Activism</a> (EAA), and Brian Tomasik’s upcoming Foundational Research Institute (FRI).

CEA has just started fundraising for cause-prioritization research which also <a href="http://prezi.com/nwbjaevxhxo2/untitled-prezi/">seems very high impact</a>, though I'd want to learn a lot more about their proposed methodology for doing so.  80,000 Hours and Giving What We Can are also trending toward better understanding of their own impact, and 80,000 Hours aims to publish some case studies soon.

While MIRI <a href="http://www.effective-altruism.com/where-im-giving-and-why-peter-hurford/#comment-1175932409">has not yet focused</a> much on more robust ways of tracking its own progress, it <a href="http://intelligence.org/2013/12/20/2013-in-review-operations/">looks like they might soon</a>, which would give some potentially strong opportunities to learn about existential risk reduction via Friendly AI research.

EAA is <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/help-us-help-animals-your-donation-giving-season">rebranding to become Animal Charity Evaluators</a> and is going to begin working a lot on research and it will be good to see how that unfolds.  There's also potentially good opportunities for learning through <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/Upcoming/studies">studies conducted on vegetarian advocacy</a> (see also <a href="http://humaneleaguelabs.wordpress.com">Humane League Labs</a>).

I don't know much about what FHI is doing, but I expect to learn more through trying to contact them.  FRI also hasn't started yet, but looks to be following <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/future-suffering-topics.html">an interesting path of research</a> that would be worth following.

I'm also exploring my own opportunities for looking into projects through <a href="http://www.dotimpact.im">.impact</a>, which will be officially launching soon.  You can see some of our ideas for making things happen on <a href="trello.com/b/npVl3e9d/effective-altruist-project-board">our Trello project board</a>.  As my <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/donations-report/">donations records show</a>, I've already begun funding some of .impact's work.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>If these things look so promising, why not just fund them now?</h4>
Because many of these orgs are currently growing, I'd be very tempted to fund them now.  However, because (a) I only have limited resources and can't just fund them all and (b) none of these organizations look at risk of decelerating their growth at the moment, I can afford to wait on my donations to learn more about my opportunities and see which ones are better or create new ones.

Not giving now also makes sense for personal reasons related to taxes, how I currently have my money invested, and large uncertainty about my personal financial situation (after graduating from college in May 2014) and personal long-long-term plans (the where I see myself in twenty years range).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Overall, I believe that learning more is a promising ticket to higher impact and will be for quite some time.  This is true for the variety of reasons which I have written above, and for other reasons that I intend to write more on later.  I'm currently uncertain about the best opportunity to learn and have limited resources, so therefore I expect to donate in a very limited fashion for six months to a year.

I thank Brad for this opportunity to explain my plans further.  I'm excited for upcoming giving opportunities and the opportunity to play a role in expanding them.  I do think that by Christmas 2014 or Christmas 2015, we'll be in a much stronger position.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>GiveDirectly: The Best Gift You Can Make This Christmas</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>In Christmas, gift giving is important.  However, it's also important to take a moment to think about how the spirit of giving can be extended to those who don't have enough money to afford Christmas.</b>  <a href="http://www.givedirectly.org">GiveDirectly</a> is a new charity that will take any cash you donate it and give it directly, no strings attached, to extremely poor families in Africa.

While GiveDirectly is very successful, they don't spend donors' money on advertising, so they rely on people like me to spread the word about direct giving.  GiveDirectly has been thoroughly vetted and is supported by <a href="http://www.givedirectly.org/evidence.php">multiple studies</a> and is currently one of the three top recommendations of <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, a very selective independent charity evaluator.  Surprisingly, they've found that such transfers result in useful spending like buying food, investing in their homes, paying school fees, or increasing their savings.  Very few recipients use it on alcohol or tobacco.

Additionally, the foundation <a href="http://www.goodventures.org">Good Ventures</a> has promised to <a href="http://www.goodventures.org/about-us/press/good-ventures-announces-5-million-in-matching-funds-for-givedirectly">match any donation to GiveDirectly</a>, so any donation you give will be doubled!  So far they've raised $1.7 million that will be matched dollar-for-dollar by Good Ventures, which translates into over $3 million that will be transferred directly to families living in extreme poverty.  However, there's still 40 days until the end of the matching challenge and $3.3 million in opportunity waiting.

If you're able to, I encourage you take advantage of this opportunity to double the value of your holiday charitable giving.  There's no way to put into words what that will mean for the recipients.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2012/08/13/productivity/">"Five Ways to Instantly Become More Productive":</a> (1) Don't multi-task; (2a) track how you spend your time; (2b) consider using apps like <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a>, <a href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/31289/selfcontrol/">Self-Control</a>, or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nanny-for-google-chrome-t/cljcgchbnolheggdgaeclffeagnnmhno">Chrome Nanny</a>; (2c) understand and be comfortable with struggling for the first couple of weeks, knowing it will make you better in the long-run; (3) only use online chat if you absolutely have to; (4a) turn off automatic email notifications; (4b) don't check your email first thing; (4c) split your email into two folders, "Action" and "Non-essential" and automatically sort each email you get as you get it, coming back to the "Action" folder later; (4d) unsubscribe from as many things in your email as you can; (5a) declutter as much as you can; (5b) turn off as many notifications as you can; and (6) start slow.  Ok, so that was actually way more than five things, but they're all good advice and I follow most of them.  For more, I wrote <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-i-am-productive/">"How I Am Productive"</a> and I've heard from a half dozen people now that they found it helpful.

Allison Smith, writing for the Animal Charity Evaluators blog whether <a href="http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/do-protests-hurt-animal-activism/">protests hurt animal activism</a>, citing a study that finds "participants were more likely to agree with the article when the author was an 'atypical' activist or was not described in activist terms at all".  This leads Smith to wonder whether activists are actually hurting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights_movement">animal rights movement</a>.  I'd be tempted to think that, however, it's important to have both hard-hitting activists and diplomatic atypical activists in the movement for reasons Greta Christina mentions about atheists and the LGBT movement in <a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2007/09/good-cop-bad-co.html">"Good Cop, Bad Cop: Atheist Activism"</a>.

In similar news, Nick Cooney <a href="http://spot.humaneresearch.org/content/changing-vegan-advocacy-art-science">wants to change vegan advocacy from an art to a science</a>.  <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/articles/youngmatt.html">"Letter to a Young Matt"</a> is also another good resource on the proper frame of mind that is needed for vegan advocacy.<!--more-->

Eliezer Yudkowsky <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gq/the_proper_use_of_humility/">distinguishes good humility from bad humility:</a> "What about the student who humbly double-checks the answers on his math test?  Again I'd categorize that as good humility.  What about a student who says, 'Well, no matter how many times I check, I can't ever be certain my test answers are correct,' and therefore doesn't check even once?  Even if this choice stems from an emotion similar to the emotion felt by the previous student, it is less wise."

Richard Yetter Chappell does some good work over at Philosophy, Etc. to <a href="http://www.philosophyetc.net/2013/12/reconciling-scalar-maximizing-and.html">reconcile scalar, maximizing, and satisficing consequentialisms</a> by breaking apart two notions of obligation: an "ought of most reason" and the "ought of minimal decency".

A pretty good way of understanding public opinion: <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2010/06/22/the_public_is_a_thermostat/">as a thermostat</a>.  Just like a thermostat cools the room when it gets warm and warms the room when it gets cold, public opinion tends to swing more Republican in Democrat majorities and vice versa.

Here's <a href="http://chrisblattman.com/advising/graduate-advising/">pretty good advice for students working on research with professors</a>.

				<title>Why Utilitarianism Says Donald Trump is a Terrorist</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Awhile ago Donald Trump made a video <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/donald-trump-fails-drop-bombshell-offers-cash-obama/story?id=17553670#.UKloh-Oe_2E">offering to donate $5 million to charity</a> if only Barack Obama would release his passport and college records.  Of course, Barack Obama ended up refusing the offer, fueling Donald Trump's long "conspiracy nut" belief that Obama wasn't really born in America.

When the due date for the deal passed, however, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/nov/1/trump-blasts-obama-ignoring-5-million-transcript-o/">Trump remarked how sad it was</a>:

<blockquote>After the deadline came and went, Mr. Trump posted a video on YouTube calling it a "very, very sad day for the United States of America." He suggested that the president's snub prevented him from giving $5 million to a group such as the Wounded Warrior Project, American Cancer Society or to the families of victims from the embassy attack in Benghazi, Libya.</blockquote>

But there's another way to think about this: why can't Mr. Trump donate the $5 million anyway?  Certainly, there's no requirement that Obama do anything for Trump to donate his money.  In a sense, Trump is playing the role of a terrorist -- he has it within his ability to easily help the family of victims, wounded warriors, or people with cancer <b>but chooses to hold these groups hostage until Obama gives into his demands.</b>

But, of course, there seems to be a critical distinction between declining to help people with your money (allowing them to be harmed through your inaction) and actively holding people hostage (doing harm to them).  However, the consequences are identical -- regardless of whether Trump is refusing to make a donation or actively being a terrorist, the wounded veterans and family victims don't get helped all the same.  Utilitarianism, in focusing on the consequences of the act, doesn't seem to recognize this critical distinction, commonly called the <i>doing-allowing distinction</i>.

In this essay, I aim to further explore utilitarianism by exploring the doing-allowing distinction.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Peter Singer's Pond</h2>
<a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter Singer">Peter Singer</a> is a famous philosopher, and he is most famous for <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/146958/peter_singer%3A_would_you_save_the_life_of_a_child">a thought experiment involving a pond</a>:

<blockquote>Imagine you come across a small child who has fallen into a pond and is in danger of drowning.  You know that you can easily and safely rescue him, but you are wearing an expensive pair of shoes that will be ruined if you do. It would be wrong–monstrous, in fact–to walk on past the pond, leaving the child to drown, because you don’t want to have to buy a new pair of shoes. You can’t compare a child’s life with a pair of shoes!</blockquote>

Everyone I have talked to endorses saving the child, even at the cost of the shoes.  Yet, as Singer argues, there is a twist -- if we would sacrifice our shoes to save a child from a pond, should we not also sacrifice our shoes (or at least the monetary cost of them) to save lives overseas?  Singer continues:

<blockquote>Yet while we all say that it would be wrong to walk past the child, there are other children whose lives we could save just as easily–and yet we don’t. UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund, estimates that nearly 9 million children under 5 die each year from causes related to poverty. That’s 24,000 a day—a football stadium full of young children, dying every day (along with thousands of older children and adults who die from poverty every day as well). Some die because they don’t have enough to eat or clean water to drink. More die from measles, malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia—diseases that don’t exist in developed nations, or if they do, are easily cured and rarely fatal.

Describing a case in Ghana, a man told a researcher from the World Bank: “Take the death of this small boy this morning, for example. The boy died of measles. We all know he could have been cured at the hospital. But the parents had no money and so the boy died a slow and painful death, not of measles but out of poverty.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Some people are motivated to deny the analogy, and I agree with those who say <a href="http://goodintents.org/aid-recipient-concerns/singers-analogy">it really isn't <i>that</i> simple</a>.  But a strong case can be made: <a href="http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Changing-Someones-Life">it's been thoroughly and compellingly established</a> via ample evidence that $1000-$2000 can prevent a case of an otherwise deadly disease in the developing world -- saving someone who would have died at 5 and instead allowing them to live out their natural life, dying instead of old age of 60.  Or, in simpler terms, $1000-$2000 can <i>save a life</i>.

However, what is the "morally relevant" difference between drowning someone intentionally (doing) and declining to save someone from drowning (allowing)?  And what would be the difference between giving someone malaria (doing) and declining to save them from malaria via a life-saving donation?  As Peter Singer would argue, there's little difference at all.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bathtubs and Doing-Allowing</h2>
Speaking of the difference between intentionally drowning someone and declining to save someone from drowning, philosopher James Rachels argues that there is no "morally relevant" difference by arguing a "contrasting case" in his paper <a href="http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/socialSciences/ppecorino/DeathandDying_TEXT/Active%20and%20Passive%20Euthanasia.pdf">"Active and Passive Euthanasia"</a> (PDF):

<blockquote>In the first, Smith stands to gain a large inheritance if anything should happen to his six-year-old cousin. One  evening while the child is taking his bath, Smith sneaks into the bathroom and drowns the child, and then arranges things so that it will look like an accident.

In the second, Jones also stands to gain if anything should happen to his six-year-old cousin. Like Smith. Jones sneaks in planning to drown the child in his bath. However, just as he enters the bathroom Jones sees the child slip and hit his head, and fall face down in the water. Jones is delighted; he stands by, ready to push the child's head back under if it is necessary, but it is not necessary. With only a little thrashing about, the child drowns all by himself, "accidentally," as Jones watches and does nothing.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Is there a relevant distinction to be made between how we evaluate the character of Smith and Jones?  Does one of them seem more malicious than the other?  Here's Rachels's analysis:

<blockquote>Now Smith killed the child, whereas Jones "merely" let the child die. That is the only difference between them. Did either man behave better, from a moral point of view? If the difference between killing and letting die were in itself a morally important matter, one should say that Jones's behavior was less eprehensible than Smith's. But does one really want to say that? I think not. In the first place, both men acted from the same motive, personal gain, and both had exactly the same end in view when they acted.

[...S]uppose Jones pleaded, in his own defense, "After all, I didn't do anything except just stand there and watch the child drown. I didn't kill him; I only let him die." Again, if letting die were in itself less bad than killing, this defense should have at least some weight. But it does not. Such a "defense" can only be regarded as a grotesque perversion of moral reasoning. Morally speaking, it is no defense at all.</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Trolley Problem</h2>
Based on the bathtub case, it seems intuitive that the doing-allowing distinction doesn't hold.  But this intuition is challenged by the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">"Trolley Problem"</a>, a thought experiment first introduced by Phillipa Foot and then extensively modified by Judith Jarvis Thompson, which is perhaps even more famous than Singer's pond.  It's typically given in two different scenarios:

<blockquote><b>Scenario #1:</b> A train is hurdling down the tracks with failed breaks.  There are five people on the track ahead of the train who cannot get off in time.  They will die unless the train is diverted onto another track by a switch.  However, that other track has one person on it who will not be able to get off in time.  Should the train be intentionally diverted, killing one person, or allowed to stay on its present course, killing five people?</blockquote>

Typically, people will remark that the train should be intentionally diverted so that more lives can be saved.  It's important to note, however, that the five people on the train are being <i>allowed</i> to die by mere inaction on behalf of the switch-flipper.  So how culpable is the person in their deaths?  Consider this additional scenario:

<blockquote><b>Scenario #1:</b> A train is hurdling down the tracks with failed breaks.  There are five people on the track ahead of the train who cannot get off in time.  This time there is no switch, but you are on a ledge with a man who would be fat enough to stop the train in time, should you push him off the ledge to his death in order to save the five.  Should the fat man be intentionally pushed, killing one person, or allowed to stay on the ledge, leading to the death of the five people?</blockquote>

Interestingly, in this scenario, a sizable majority of people change their mind and argue that the fat man should not be killed, even though they had just endorsed the "kill one to save five" principle established earlier.  The difference here does seem to be the doing-allowing distinction -- in the case of flipping the switch, you are impersonally changing events to allow one person to die instead of allowing five people to die; but in the case of the footbridge, you are <i>killing</i> (doing) the fat man.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Of Euthanasia and Automatic Bank Accounts</h2>
Escaping the world of ponds, bathtubs, and trolleys, we can bring the doing-allowing distinction to the more practical world.  Consider the controversial case of euthanasia -- if someone is in unbearable pain and is going to die with no hope of rescue, it seems like we should end their pain.  However, it is not acceptable to outright kill the patient -- that would be murder!  Instead, the patient can be <i>allowed to die</i> by declining to continue life supporting treatment, and that's legal.

But as Richard Chappell points out in his essay <a href="http://www.philosophyetc.net/2006/01/doing-and-allowing.html">"Doing and Allowing"</a>, we could conceive of a strange life support machine that is set to turn itself off automatically unless the doctor intervenes to push a button to turn it back on.  That way, whenever a decision is made to terminate life support, it is the doctor merely refraining from pushing the button and allowing the patient to die rather than doing something to the patient.

Likewise, we could conceive of a bank account where we deposit our income that is set to automatically donate 10% of the contents to an effective non-profit organization.  Here, any spending of our income deliberately reduces the pool to be donated and thus deliberately deprives people from receiving life-saving treatment, just like your inaction to actually donate a portion of your income used to.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Here, in these two scenarios, the doing-allowing distinction falls apart.  So what are we to do?  The doing-allowing distinction is on shaky ground, and should be rejected.  But does this mean that Donald Trump should be considered a terrorist and that we are all murderers for refusing to donate as much as possible to charity?

In the next essay, I'll sketch out a utilitarian account of blameworthiness that takes into account quality of will, and argues that we should donate income to charity because it is an incredibly worthy action, not because we are monsters for failing to do so.  ...Trump, I hope you have your check for $5 million handy.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'll take a counter-position and argue that the doing-allowing distinction serves a social coordination function of very high practical value and that undermining it is an anti-utilitarian action on the meta-level.

A difference between giving Malaria to a person and omitting a Malaria-devoted donation is that one constitutes an act of aggression while the other doesn't. 

Altruistically punishing aggressors is such an important social function that it should not be undermined. Equating everyone who omits a helpful action with an aggressor creates an inflationary view of aggression and lowers overall standards of personal responsibility (we are all aggressors unless we pay off every beggar on the planet).

There is also an incentive problem. Active aggression is easier to track as forgone potential for cooperation and productivity. It's easy to point to Donald Trump because he already has money and talks about donations. But what happens in a world where property is strongly redistributed by force, or strong social condemnation is used for the omission of voluntary redistribution? The self-interested incentive to acquire wealth in the first place is reduced. The rational response for the self-interested person is to reduce their productivity and investment.

Now one could argue that forgoing productivity or investment potential could also be socially equated with aggression. But this not only violates very common intuitions of personal freedom (therefore creating socially harmful emotions of offensiveness), but even worse, it faces the problem of plausible deniability.

If a child drowns where I am present, I can be flagged as responsible and therefore don't have much plausible deniability. If a child drowns where I <i>might</i> be present, but could choose not to be, I have plausible deniability - I can choose not to be present because I anticipate the cost.

In the world of economic productivity and resource efficiency, there are myriad ways in which any actor can gain plausible deniability. You can pretend not to have certain types of information. You can pretend to see priorities slightly differently. You can pretend to see economic development probabilities slightly differently. You can pretend to be less competent than you are. You can pretend to be less healthy than you are. You can cut down on your hygiene. You can be slower than you could be. You can smile less at your customers than you theoretically could. And so on and so on, ad infinitum.

No one has the power to track all this and judge people accurately. This is why positive incentives are so much more useful than blaming people for not being productive enough.

But once we start morally treating omissions of wealth transfers as though they were aggression, the self-interested incentives shift from being productive to pretending to be unable to be more productive.

And that is harmful for everyone. Peter Singer would do well to take this seriously.]]></wp:comment_content>

The whole point of preventing murder is that people can feel save from being killed against their will. Consensual murder is not actually murder, just like consensual sex is not rape.

To pretend otherwise again lowers the standards of personal responsibility and in the case of voluntary euthanasia, it undermines people's freedom to control their own suffering. Both are obvious anti-utilitarian effects.]]></wp:comment_content>

You make a fair point about incentive effects that is important to keep in mind.  This is definitely a more robust understanding of doing-allowing that leads to Richard Chappel's <a href="http://www.philosophyetc.net/2012/04/singers-pond-and-quality-of-will.html" rel="nofollow">"quality of will" account of blameworthiness</a>, which I endorse.

That being said, the doing-allowing distinction as a philosophical primitive is both silly and dangerous in some contexts, so it's important to rethink.

I've made a variety of New Years Resolutions this year to commit to exercise.  I decided that I want a more detailed log to keep track of my progress on these plans so I know where to resume for future exercises and look back on my progress.  I then decided, in the spirit of my <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-reading">reading list</a> and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-watching">TV list</a>, why not make this public too?

Currently, I'm working on (1) <a href="http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/">Stronglifts 5x5 Beginner Strength Training Program</a> and (2) running once a week.  Whenever I don't have access to a gym with free weights, I'll try to substitute with exercise machines or the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_beginner_routine">r/bodyweightfitness routine</a> when possible.

Nothing in this list is meant to be that awe inspiring.  I recognize myself as below average at fitness, but I'm getting much better.<!--more-->

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions-december-edition/">"New Years Resolutions: December Edition"</a></i>

Well, happy new year, everyone!

Many people may come to this new year armed with new years resolutions.  I, however, come armed with the resolutions I brought all the way from January 2013.  I did it -- a full year of (mostly) sticking to my new years resolutions.

In this essay, I'll overview how I did in December, overview how I did in 2013 overall, and then set up resolutions for January 2014.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Did December Go?</h2>
<b>Points:</b>  My goal was to score 17205 “daypoints” over the month according to my scoring system where different habits of mine are assigned different point values for each day.  Overall, I earned 16725 points, which was 97.2% of my goal.

<b>Time on task:</b> This month I spent an average of 8.98 hours a day working (a 62.86 hour work week), which is down from November's 74.06 week, October's 74.9 hour work week, and September's 81.5 hour work week, which means I'm still trending downward, which could be problematic.  (Note that work includes everything I do that's not sleep, reading, eating, exercising, showering, getting dressed, hanging out with friends/family, video games, spacing out, watching TV, and other commonsense things.)

<b>Time with friends/family:</b> I spent an average of 4.72 hours a day with friends/family, which is up from 4.2hrs/day in November and up from 3.3 hours a day in October.

<b>Exercise:</b> I spent an average of 31.45 minutes a day <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-is-peter-exercising/">doing exercise</a> -- <a href="http://www.stronglifts.com/">Stronglifts</a> and some running (down from 58.3 minutes/day in November and 64.5 minutes/day in October).  I improved my deadlift (215lbs to 235lbs) and squat (from 190lbs to 200lbs), but I did not improve my benchpress (stayed at 85lbs), or running distance (stayed at 6.2mi).

<b>Other Goals:</b> I met my goals for sleeping 69% (down from 75%) of the time, breakfast 81% (down from 90%) of the time, lunch 87% (down from 90%), dinner 71% (up from 50%), not snacking 16% (down from 45%), cleanliness 81% (down from 93%), and order 93% (up from 88%).

<b>Overall:</b> Overall, I have not failed my resolutions, but I have backslid on a lot of them, noticeably.  I'm going to need to turn this around for 2014.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2013 Overall</h2>
Being disappointed at sliding away from my resolutions from October through December, it's hard to remember the sorry state that I was in back in January 2013 and how much better I am compared to that.  Things have transformed a lot -- what started as a goal to publicly precommit ended up transforming into the Monthly Review as a part of <a href="">David Allen's <b>Getting Things Done</b></a>, with a complex point system.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Diet</h4>
I started out on <a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/">the No S Diet</a> (No Snacks, No Sweets, No Seconds, except (Sometimes) on Saturdays, Sundays, and Special days).  For this, I had 100% success (Jan) and 90.9% success (Feb).  I then amended the diet to be Friday/Saturday instead of Saturday/Sunday, allowed myself to have Raisin Bran and Chocolate Milk, and allowed myself to accept snacks given out by others.  I continued to have 100% success (Mar) and 100% success (April).

For May, I adopted diet goals to (1) eat less than 2438kcal to ensure I lose weight, (2) eat at least 56g of protein each day, and (3) drink at least 2.5 liters of water each day, but I was unsuccessful because I was on a program that provided meals for me and my diet was largely out of my control.

For June, I switched to the point system I currently have and assigned point values to those three goals and added another goal: I would eat at least one fruit and one vegetable.  I fell a bit short on each goal, consuming on average 2/2.5L of water, 100g/56g of protein, 70% success at eating a fruit and vegetable, and 47% success at eating less than 2174kcal.

For July, I decided to restrict my diet even less and modified my goals to drink 5 cups of water and 5 cups of milk a day and consume a daily protein bar.  I stayed on the water habit 80% of the time and the milk habit 55% of the time, but was not able to find protein bars in England, where I was staying.

For August, I kept the milk and water goals and added a goal to eat broccoli each day and avoid sweets and fried foods.  I stayed on the water habit 100% of the time, the milk habit 87% of the time, broccoli 26%, avoiding sweets 45%, and avoiding fried foods 97%.

For September, I followed the <a href="">food plate</a> and set a goal to drink 5 cups of water, 4 cups of milk, 2 servings of fruit, 5 servings of grains, and 4 servings of vegetables.  My average was 4.23/5 water, 3.67/4 milk, 1.97/2 fruit, 4.2/5 grains, and 3.1/4 vegetables.

For October through Decemeber, I noticed that since I was doing my own grocery shopping and don't mind not having variety, I could just set a particular diet for every day and use <a href="http://www.cronometer.com">Cronometer</a> to ensure good macronutrients, micronutrients, and calories.  I then divided these goals into "breakfast", "lunch", "dinner", and "no snacks" goals.  Overall I was successful at breakfast 90%, 90%, and 81% of the time; lunch 90%, 90%, 87%; dinner 50%, 50%, 71%; and not snacking 45%, 45%, 16%.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Exercise</h4> 
I started out pledging to <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml">Couch to 5K</a>, <a href="http://www.hundredpushups.com/#sthash.oy6Cm6ax.4S9wegRE.dpbs">One Hundred Pushups</a>, and <a href="http://www.twohundredsitups.com/">Two Hundred Situps</a>.  I stayed on goal 95% of the time.

By February, I dropped that completely, switching instead to running as much as I could of a 5K and walking what I couldn't and did a modified version of the Mount Holyoke <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_D_IjuAUl8">No Excuses Workout</a>.  I stayed on goal 88% of the time.  I did the same for March, but fell off the wagon and only stayed on goal 47% of the time.  For April, I was on goal 89% of the time.

On the 23rd of April, I switched out the No Excuses workout for <a href="http://www.stronglifts.com">Stronglifts 5x5</a> (along with running once a week).  On May, I stayed on goal 95% of the time.  Also, in May I finally did a 5K and now just tried to aim to add more distance each time I ran.

For June, I added a goal for walking, looking to exercise an average of 20 minutes a day and walk an average of 40 minutes a day (though, of course, not exercising and walking every day).  I ended up having an average of 23/20 minutes of exercise and walked 38/40 minutes a day.

For July, I ended up losing access to a gym with weights, so I began <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0938045768">Convict Conditioning</a> with the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1gbfx2/training_for_34_hours_a_day_6_days_a_week_as_ido/">Reddit modifications</a> (along with running).  I spent an average of 30 minutes a day exercising.

For August, I was biking regularly to commute, so I spent an average of 124 minutes a day doing exercise (biking, Convict Conditioning, and running).  In September, I was no longer biking and I spent an average of 36 minutes a day exercising. In October, I resumed Stronglifts and spent an average of 64.5 minutes a day doing exercise, running twice a week for longer.  In November, I spent an average of 58.3 minutes a day doing exercise.  In December, I spent an average of 31.45 minutes a day.

Overall, I made considerable gains in fitness.  Running went up from a max distance of 0.5mi to 6.2mi.  My benchpress went up from 45lbs (in late April) to 85lbs, squat from 45lbs to 200lbs, and deadlift from 135lbs to 215lbs.  I also went from 210lbs to a low of 172lbs and now currently weigh a healthy 180lbs.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Productivity</h4>
For April, I started doing "4x4hr Productivity" where, four days a week, for four hours each, I committed to working with <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">The Pomodoro Technique</a>.  In April, I was successful 76% of the time.  I lost my records for May.  In June, I spent an average of 7 hours a day working.  In July, 10hrs.  August, 9.93hrs.  September, 11.6hrs.  October, 10.7hrs.  November, 10.58hrs.  December, 8.98hrs.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Annual Goals</h4>
Back in the <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions/">first post</a>, I stated some goals I wanted to accomplish by the end of the year.  I ended up not accomplishing very few of these because my priorities changed.

<b>200 essays in 2013:</b> Overall, I wrote 163 essays in 2013.  I had a goal of writing 200.  I decided that it wasn't worth writing essays just for the sake of writing them and I ended up, on occasion, deciding that doing other work was higher priority than writing, so I didn't make this goal.

<b>Add four games to the arcade:</b> Likewise, I didn't end up making much progress on games because I decided that working on games was not the best way to learn programming further.  I think I accomplished the spirit of this goal by rekindling my role as a computer programmer, even though I approached it in a different way.

<b>Earn >$6000:</b> Similarly, I did not end up earning more than $6000 in income.  This is because I decided that I had higher priority things to do with my time than earn money and I'm in a lucky position where I can spend my time as I want.

<b>Spend <$2000:</b> Moreover, I did not end up spending <$2000.  I didn't account for the fact that I would end up buying my own food as a college senior or have other significant expenses like going to London for an internship.

<b>Get my drivers license:</b>  I ended up failing this goal as well.  This is the one I do regret not accomplishing and feel a little embarrassed about.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is New for January 2014?</h2>
I'm going to end up continuing as before, applying a few lessons I've learned along the way.

<b>I still like the point system.</b>  Generally it's a bad idea to say "just one won't hurt" because people end up taking this too far and derailing from their habits.  But it's also true that just one really won't hurt.  The point system lets me reconcile this by allowing me to get away with a little bit without losing too much.

<b>I still like focusing on inputs rather than outputs.</b>  It's very difficult to work with a goal like "get stronger" or "lose weight", even when they're specific ("gain 20lbs on squat", "lose 20lbs").  This is because you don't really have a whole lot of direct control over your strength and weight.  But you do have control over what you do to get stronger and lose weight -- you can change your diet and exercise.  So I focus on those inputs, diet and exercise, rather than outputs, like strength and weight.

<b>I won't be setting any more year-long goals</b> (except for getting my drivers license).  I was really bad at predicting my year-long priorities.  I expect to be similarly bad at predicting my priorities, so I don't think it will be worth setting these kinds of goals.

<b>I'm going to be more focused about taking breaks for harder goals.</b>  When I did the No S Diet, I was really good at avoiding snacks.  When I just lost points for eating snacks, I've been pretty bad at it.  That's because I think it was a lot easier knowing to resist snacks when I had particular days I could cheat.  So I think I'll do the same and pick cheat days for harder goals.

<b>I need to be more careful when changing environments.</b>  A lot of my success at sticking to resolutions is based on a good routine, and routines are disrupted by moving (from college to home and back again, England, etc.).  I need to be more careful about constructing a good routine the moment I move.]]></content:encoded>

I expect to be similarly bad at predicting my priorities, so I don’t think it will be worth setting these kinds of goals.</blockquote>

Random 3:00 AM idea: It seems like the problem with some of the annual goals you set at the start of 2013 was that they focused on a particular <em>implementation</em> by which you could accomplish your aims. When that implementation turned out to be less than effective (writing X blog posts, adding X games), you had to drop the original goal entirely. What do you think about instead making the goals broader, encompassing the entire aims themselves, and only allowing the methods for measuring your progress to fluctuate? (I'm thinking of analogies in programming, where encapsulation [1] makes OOP systems more flexible and portable, and in public policy, where some favor performance-based regulation over more prescriptive forms.)

For example, rather than aiming to add a specific number of games to your arcade, you could set a goal to "become a better programmer," and specify multiple possible implementations through which the goal could be achieved. [2] As the year progresses (maybe at monthly- or biannual-review time) you could analyze the efficacy of these implementations and revise them / add altogether new implementations.

[1]: i.e., establishing a public "interface" that sets strictures for how a system appears to and communicates with the outside world, but leaving the actual implementation of these processes as private and thus easily changeable.
[2]: Possibly integrate this with your point system? Certain implementations could be "worth" more than others based on their difficulties, and you can declare that you've accomplished a certain goal when you have gained a certain amount of points from succeeding in multiple implementations associated with that goal.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<blockquote>For example, rather than aiming to add a specific number of games to your arcade, you could set a goal to “become a better programmer,” and specify multiple possible implementations through which the goal could be achieved.  As the year progresses (maybe at monthly- or biannual-review time) you could analyze the efficacy of these implementations and revise them / add altogether new implementations.</blockquote>

This is a good idea.  I think I'll do this.  I'm not sure how to implement it into the point system (or whether this would be a good idea), but I can definitely list some general goals out and then track progress toward them qualitatively on a monthly basis.  Thanks!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/sunday-links-20/#comment-2824">promised to make the link roundups relate a little better</a>, so here you go:

***

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals">The Millenium Development Goals</a> set priorities for governments and NGOs working to help the developing world.  However, the current set only covers 2000-2015, so <a href="http://www.post2015hlp.org/the-report/">a new set</a> is being developed for 2015-2030.  What should be included?  <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-07-30/measuring-what-matters-two-key-indicators-for-the-successor-development-goals">Toby Ord suggests</a> including a metric of "healthy life expectancy", or life expectancy weighted by quality of life, and "log income", which correlates pretty highly with life satisfaction.

The implications of "log income" is that giving money to the poorest should more easily boost total world satisfaction than giving the money most other places.  Luckily, there's an organization, <a href="http://www.givedirectly.org">Give Directly</a>, that does just that, who I've <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/givedirectly-the-best-gift-you-can-make-this-christmas/">profiled earlier</a>.  They're also profiled in Tina Rosenberg's Fixes Column entry <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/the-benefits-of-cash-without-conditions">"The Benefits of Cash Without Conditions"</a>.

Peter Singer argues that if you'd save the life of a small child near you, <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/146958/peter_singer%3A_would_you_save_the_life_of_a_child">you should also be willing to donate to one of these charities</a>.  After all, the idea of distance mattering in ethics <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/17/newtonian-ethics/">is quite weird indeed</a>.

Also, in a related note, Carl Shulman works <a href="http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/01/turning-log-consumption-into-measure-of.html">to try and turn log-income and log-consumption into better metrics of human welfare</a>.<!--more-->

<a href="http://www.govexec.com/excellence/promising-practices/2013/01/googles-8-simple-rules-being-better-manager/60882/">Google has eight simple rules for being a better manager:</a> (1) be a good coach, (2) empower your team and don't micromanage, (3) express interest in team members' success and personal well-being, (4) be productive and results-oriented, (5) be a good communicator, (6) help employees with career development, (7) have a clear vision and strategy, and (8) have key technical skills so you can be an advisor.

In a related note, <a href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2013/09/6-psych-tips-for-creating-the-ideal-workspace.php">"Six Psych Tips for Creating the Ideal Workspace"</a>: (1) avoid open-plan; (2) both messy and untidy desks have their place, depending on the type of outcome you are looking for; (3) prefer curvy environments over straight edges, (4) have a room with a view or a picture of a view, (5) include lots of plants, and (6) decorate.

<a href="http://www.philosophyetc.net/2012/11/ethics-as-whats-worth-caring-about.html">"Ethics as What's Worth Caring About":</a> "The utilitarian can simply say, 'I care about people!  I want everyone to be as well-off as possible.'  And that seems a pretty attractive goal!  There seems no doubt that people's welfare (and, more broadly, the welfare of sentient beings) is worth caring about.  Is anything else comparably important, or worth caring about?  Take promises.  People sometimes criticize utilitarianism on the grounds that it affords no intrinsic significance to promise-keeping, so utilitarians may be expected to break promises (at least when it's sufficiently clear that it really would be for the best).  But does it really make sense to care about promises more than people?  That sounds terribly perverse!  Promises can be a useful tool for coordination, and hence serving our collective interests.  But when promise-keeping and human welfare diverge, surely it's the latter that really matters."

A somewhat related triumph for utilitarianism comes from the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/bk/the_trouble_with_good/">The Trouble With "Good"</a>: "One person can go on and on for months about all the reasons the Israelis are totally right and the Palestinians are completely in the wrong, and another person can go on just as long about how the Israelis are evil oppressors and the Palestinians just want freedom. And then if you ask them about an action, or a decision, or a state - they've never thought about it. They'll both answer something like 'I dunno, the two-state solution or something?'. And if they still disagree at this level, you can suddenly apply the full power of utilitarianism to the problem in a way that tugs sideways to all of their personal prejudices.  In general, any debate about whether something is 'good' or 'bad' is sketchy, and can be changed to a more useful form by converting the thing to an action and applying utilitarianism."

<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathy-freston/religion-vegetarianism-_b_3874652.html?utm_hp_ref=tw">"God, Christianity, and Meat"</a> -- an interesting religious perspective on vegetarianism: "I was delighted to learn about this rich tradition of incorporating vegetarian diets into spiritual practice, but I admit that it first surprised me. It certainly is not something most Christians in America know about. If you do some searching like I did, though -- even simply by searching "Christianity and vegetarianism" on the Internet -- it's easy to see just how important the idea of peace between all creatures has been in the Christian moral imagination."

<a href="http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/04/25/were-all-bad-at-math-1-i-feel-stupid-too/">"What it Feels Like to Be Bad at Math"</a> (also applicable to all other hard subjects and things): "As I procrastinated, spending more time at dinner complaining about topology than in the library doing topology, I realized that procrastination isn’t just about laziness. It’s about anxiety. To work on something you don’t understand means facing your doubts and confusions head-on. Procrastination pushes back that painful confrontation."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've talked about .impact in a few other places, but now we've finally written a summary of it and have launched a new website. Look here to see what we're up to!

<a href="http://dotimpact.im/2014/01/05/introducing-dotimpact/">"Introducing .impact"</a>:

<blockquote>There are many project ideas that could be really useful for the effective altruist community. There are people with the skills and free time to make things happen but who lack guidance or support. .impact aims to provide infrastructure to get people and useful projects together. We hope to help volunteers learn useful skills, meet great people, and create something substantial.

We’re soon launching <a href="http://skillshare.im/">Skillshare.im</a>, a place to share skills and services for free. We collaborated on several Trello boards to <a href="https://trello.com/b/npVl3e9d/effective-altruist-project-board">organize projects</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/b/shY5TwCm/effective-altruist-research-topics">research topics</a>, and <a href="https://trello.com/b/F3O577AH/ea-productivity-resources">useful resources</a>. We’ve brainstormed and started outlining projects like a <a href="https://impact.hackpad.com/Studying-Vegetarian-Advocacy-m11aW51ENVW">vegetarian advocacy study</a>, an <a href="https://impact.hackpad.com/EA-Wiki-y8z6wp5yCxD">EA wiki</a>, and <a href="https://impact.hackpad.com/Argument-Mapper-hNKt3IU7gAv">argument mapping software</a>. We’ve had <a href="http://dotimpact.im/meetings.html">several weekly group hangouts and discussions</a> with a variety of individuals. Most of our general discussion holds place in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/dotimpact/">our Facebook group</a>, which now has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/dotimpact/members/">114 members</a> and seems to be growing organically at a rate of 5 per week.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Someone asked me what the top ten posts are on Everyday Utilitarian.  I use Google Analytics, so this was a pretty easy thing to find out.  I looked at page visits for each essay over all of 2013.  Of course, this isn't a perfect metric, as essays written later in the year have less of a chance of getting viewed, and the "hits" metric is skewed a lot toward what I choose to publicize via Facebook and LessWrong and what I don't.

So this isn't much of a "top ten" by quality, I suppose.  But here it goes, anyway:

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-i-am-productive/">How I Am Productive</a> (1618 pageviews)</li>

				<title>My Case Study: I (Mostly) Finished Choosing Between Careers</title>

Back in May 2013, I realized I would be graduating in a year and wondered a lot about what I should pick for my first career. The questions I had at the time were:

<ol>
<p><li>Should I aim to work in an Effective Altruist organization, go to graduate school, or should I earn to give?</li></p>
<p><li>Where should I look for employment if I want to earn to give &#8211; law, market research, or programming?</li></p>
<p><li>I spent a little time considering other options (finance and consulting careers), but the bulk of my time was spent comparing EA org employment, grad school, and the three earning to give careers.</li></p>
</ol>
<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
<ul>
<p><li>Direct work in EA is promising, but there are limited employment opportunities and a generally strong base of talent to draw from that makes replaceability an issue.</li></p>
<p><li>Graduate school also seems promising, but programs with high direct impact seem limited in employment opportunities.</li></p>
<p><li>It’s important to consider factors about the career other than salary when doing earning to give. Law was my best earning to give opportunity at first glance, given that it had the highest salary of the options I was willing to consider. But when I looked more deeply at non-salary factors, it became my worst option.</li></p>
<p><li>Market research and computer programming are my most promising paths and I should consider both further. They allow good salary potential while offering many other benefits.</li></p>
<p><li>Publishing my ongoing thought process was valuable in ways I couldn’t even imagine at the time, creating the opportunity to meet people I couldn’t have met otherwise.</li></p>
<p><li>Spending time directly in Oxford was also incredibly valuable in meeting with people that could help me think through my decision process.</li></p>
<p><li>An analytically-minded person can train in programming quickly enough to seriously consider programming as a career path. While I started with intermediate computer programming knowledge in irrelevant computer languages, it took me about 150 hours of training over 20 weeks to know enough to interview competently. I don’t know if this is a unique case, though.</li></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My methodology</h2>
First, I compiled a list of every high impact career I could conceive of. I then narrowed the list down to the careers I thought were worth pursuing further, based on personal factors, and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-careers-plan/">published that information online</a> for comments.

After a bit of time following up on the comments I received from publishing, I then deliberately set out, crafted a set of questions I wanted to know about various opportunities, and interviewed people about them. I ended up having informational interviews with 31 different people, including five people from 80,000 Hours.

At the same time, I did an internship at Giving What We Can in Oxford, England. This taught me a lot about the opportunities for direct work and put me in a position to meet with 80,000 Hours and a lot of other effective altruists.

Based on the information I gathered from my interviews, I compared my five options on the basis of 11 different criteria, as suggested by 80,000 Hours. I also pursued all five options to the best of my ability until I had the confidence to eliminate options. Eventually, I came to a final decision I could be confident in.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Why these five categories, and not others?</h4>
There were many careers I didn’t consider much -- such as finance, consulting, and medicine &#8211; which seem to be popular careers of those who use 80,000 Hours’s research. I didn’t choose any of these three careers mainly because I felt underqualified and felt that they would be enough of a poor fit for me enjoyment-wise that I wouldn’t do well enough in the career. I’m currently open to changing my mind on finance due to the extremely high earning potential, however.

Some opportunities for direct work, like fundraising (along the lines of <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/">Effective Fundraising's</a> model), I didn’t investigate further because the options were too limited. Other opportunities, like working in non-profit organizations doing work on the ground, like Innovations for Poverty Action, didn’t seem to match my skills or interests very well and didn’t seem enjoyable to me.

I also didn’t feel comfortable and confident enough to be an entrepreneur. While I’m open to potentially creating a start-up someday, I wanted a lot more knowledge of how organizations work and what the market is like.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What was my first guess?</h4>
My first guess, made on May 2013, was that the best thing for me to do would be to do direct work (seek employment in the Centre for Effective Altruism) and enter law school and do earning to give if the first plan didn’t work.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What factors did I use to compare my careers?</h2>
After talking with Jess Whittlestone and Nick Beckstead from 80,000 Hours, I adopted the following 9 criteria for evaluating my career:

<ul>
<p><li><strong>Direct Impact:</strong> The actions of the career itself directly improve the world. (Technically, all these other measures are supposed to be measures of indirect impact.)</li></p>
<p><li><strong>Earnings:</strong> The career has a large compensation package.</li></p>
<p><li><strong>Skills:</strong> The career will develop me in valuable, personal, transferable skills that are useful for furthering my career or otherwise being better at effective altruism.</li></p>
<p><li><strong>Connections:</strong> The career will connect me with people that can help me a lot down the road.</p></li></p>
<p><li><strong>Credentials:</strong> The career will look good on my resume, improve my impressiveness for employers, and qualify me for better jobs.</li></p>
<p><li><strong>Information Value:</strong> The career teaches me more about what career opportunities there are and improves the quality of my future career choices.</li></p>
<p><li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The career keeps my options open in terms of allowing me to switch to another career easily.</li></p>
<p><li><strong>Enjoyment:</strong> I would enjoy the career.</li></p>
<p><li><strong>Replaceability:</strong> I’m not doing something that someone else easily would do just as well.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Should I do direct work?</h2>
Direct work seemed good on direct impact, skills, connections, flexibility, and enjoyment, but weak on earnings, credentials, information value, and replaceability. I spent a lot of time trying to assess my own replaceability in direct work before a conversation with Satvik Beri outlined an incredibly simple procedure &#8211; just ask EA organizations whether they’d rather have you or money. I was in a good position to do this, having just interned for an EA organization.

While I interned, I felt like I produced above average work, but I didn’t think my work was significantly better and I hadn’t adjusted for the fact that people tend to think more highly of themselves than is justified. When I take these two aspects into account, replaceability becomes a concern.

However, a larger concern for me that emerged after talking to people was that employment in an EA organization is actually rather difficult to come by, given a limited number of positions and for the time-being has high standards in recruiting due to being a start-up and needing lots of particular skills. This was especially a concern for me given that I am an American citizen but most desire employment in the UK-based Centre for Effective Altruism, as CEA faces some difficulty in hiring Americans full-time.

A final concern of mine was the possibility of coming to a major disagreement with CEA about what the best approach is for making the world a better place. While this was not a dominant consideration, the flexibility and independence provided by an earning to give career seems like a benefit to me. This seemed especially true if I picked a career that still affords me training in skills relevant to EA direct work and/or gives me a significant amount of time to volunteer for EA causes, as I could transition to direct work if I felt like my skills were better served there than earning. Generally, I felt like it is easier to transition from earning-to-give to direct work than it is to transition from direct work to earning-to-give.

Therefore, I decided to no longer seek full-time direct work for the time-being. However, I still believe that some kinds of direct work (personal EA side-projects) are higher value to me than spending the time earning a high salary, so I want to choose a career that allows me the flexibility to also have a significant side-project / volunteering component.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Should I go to graduate school?</h2>
If I chose this option, I would pursue a Ph.D. in either political science or psychology. I had considered a Ph.D. in economics, but felt underqualified and felt like I wouldn’t enjoy it enough to make it worthwhile. I was searching for programs that would allow me to study the psychology of civic engagement, volunteerism, and/or donating. For example, I became very attracted to the work of Elizabeth Dunn at the University of British Columbia and considered trying to apply there (see <a href='http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog/tabid/107/ID/45/Flipping-the-Philanthropy-Switch.aspx'>“Flipping the Philanthropy Switch”</a> over at The Life You Can Save for more on this kind of work).

This option seemed to be strong on connections, credentials, enjoyment, replaceability, and skills (though skills is debated as the skills learned may only be useful for academic work). However, it seemed weak on flexibility/risk and earnings. It also would be weak on direct impact depending on what program I chose.

Ultimately, I decided against graduate school and while I did take the GRE (the US admissions test for grad schools), I chose not to move forward on any applications. While I found research to be high-value, my intuition was that I would have more influence in making key research happen by funding research rather than carrying it out. Also, I felt like I could do a large majority of the research I want to do (currently, mostly stuff related to studying vegetarianism) without taking on the costs of graduate school. Lastly, I felt like there were enough people already working in the graduate programs I had considered that I wouldn’t add much (one could think of this as having no “room for more people”, as an analogy to “room for more funding” in GiveWell top charities).

While I think it’s unlikely, I wouldn’t rule out trying to apply to graduate schools in late 2014 or late 2015, however.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How good is law for earning to give?</h2>
With graduate school and direct work out of the way, I focused up more on earning to give. The first I focused on was law as I saw that it had the highest salary potential of the options I was considering. If I pursued law, I would aim to enter corporate law, which pays at $160K per year and then rises by ~$10K/year for ten years before you have an opportunity to make partner and earn $500K/year to millions a year depending on the firm. Law seemed strong on salary, connections, replaceability, and credentials, but had drawbacks in skills, direct impact, information value, and enjoyment. It is also utterly terrible in flexibility, considering I would have to pay money into three years of law school before I would earn anything.

I was pretty keen on law for several months as a top choice, but I ultimately stopped valuing it as much as I started to place more emphasis on personal enjoyment, skills development, and flexibility. Eventually, having to commit three years and $50-$150K to law school with no promise that I would end up in a situation that worked well for me was a pretty clear deal-breaker.

Another aspect of law that I came to really not like was the expected long hours of the job, which would prevent me from being able to spend significant amounts of time on EA side projects. Since I expect that I will be able to do side projects that produce more EA value than earning to give, this also made me not like law as much relative to the more 40-60 hour a week careers.

I still took the LSAT (the US entrance exam for law schools) anyway, because I had prepared for it a lot, and thought it would be nice to have the score. I ended up doing well on it, but not well enough that my admittance to the top 10 law schools would be likely. (Common wisdom suggests that one needs to be in a top 10 law school in order to have a good shot at a corporate law job.) So, unless I retake the LSAT, this option was pretty much over whether I wanted it to be or not. Given that I had already decided before seeing my LSAT score that I didn’t want to do law, I wasn’t that upset.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How good is market research for earning to give?</h2>
The general idea is that I’d seek employment doing statistics for a market research firm. This seemed strong on skills, flexibility, enjoyment, replaceability, and information value and not particularly weak on much, though salary, credentials, and connections seem weaker than other options, relatively.

Salaries are lower in market research, with starting salaries in the $40K-$60K range and less indication of upward movement in salaries with promotion. But one potential advantage I hadn’t considered much is that few EAs, if any, had gone into market research, so it could be a ripe new field to explore for EA potential, especially if marketing principles could then be applied directly to the EA movement. Therefore, I’m still seeking employment in market research.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How good is programming for earning to give?</h2>
I also considered computer programming as an earning to give career, which is quite popular in the effective altruism movement. Like market research, this also seemed strong on skills, flexibility, enjoyment, replaceability, and information value and not particularly weak on much. Salaries are good, starting in the $50-$80K range and rising upward to $120-$200K, I think.

The interesting thing about computer programming for me is that, while I was a long-time hobbyist programmer, I had never really pursued programming seriously, I didn’t have a tremendous amount of experience, and I lacked a computer science degree. So I needed to spend a significant amount of time learning programming. Luckily, the market for programming jobs is good and a lot of companies are willing to focus on “on-the-job learning” if you can demonstrate your general aptitude and your ability to learn quickly.

This sounds good to me, so I’m still seeking employment in programming.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What was my “final” decision?</h2>
Ultimately, I decided to go with a model where I would mix both direct work and earning to give by seeking full-time employment for 40-60 hours a week, but then spending significant portion of my “free time” volunteering and doing EA side projects. I liked this model the most because I expect the side projects to be worth more than additional salary and it should teach me more about the comparison between earning to give and direct work.

Six months after starting my plan to learn about jobs (and one month after sending applications), I received an offer of an 8-week “trial hire” internship from <a href='http://www.avantcredit.com'>AvantCredit</a>, a web development start-up that offers online loans to people with near-prime credit ratings. I got this offer on the basis of experience in both web development and statistics. I accepted the offer and I’m excited to be employed there.

AvantCredit offers a mixture of interesting challenges in both programming and statistics, which are two skill-bases of mine I want to improve. The office culture sounds pretty awesome. Additionally, I’ll gain experience about what it’s like to be in a start-up and learn more about finance and financial risk, in case I want to look more in finance. I also think there’s a strong chance I might end up staying with AvantCredit long-term.

Longer-term, I’m still looking at careers in market research and computer programming. I’m also looking into jobs that offer <a href='http://doublethedonation.com/matching-grant-resources/list-matching-gifts-companies/'>particularly high donation matching</a>, which is basically <a href='http://80000hours.org/blog/168-how-to-double-your-donations-with-no-extra-effort'>like a raise for effective altruists</a>, though I haven’t explored this much in depth.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
I really liked the methodology I ended up using. Initially, I was worried that writing up information about my career choice publicly could lead to employers viewing my application more negatively and hurting my chances at receiving offers. I still can’t rule this out, but I do think the benefits of publicly publishing have more than made up for it. Publishing the work lead to people commenting on it who became great contacts that I would not have made any other way. One of these contacts ended up telling me about AvantCredit and giving me an internal referral. I don’t think I would have received the offer without his help, let alone known to apply in the first place.

I also think it was a really good idea to take an internship at Giving What We Can, which I actually considered not doing at one point (because I was worried about not seeing my family for most of the summer). There really is no substitute for joining an EA hub directly and meeting tons of EAs in person.

Lastly, I learned that you apparently can train yourself to learn enough programming to get a job offer at a moderately quick pace, though I may have got lucky with a variety of things. I spent 10 hours a week on programming over a period of about 10 weeks, and about 5 hours a week on programming for the 10 weeks before that, prior to receiving the AvantCredit offer. In doing so, I was able to significantly increase my knowledge of jQuery, Ruby on Rails, and R. I hope to up this commitment to make sure I’m even more ready when I get there and when looking at other companies. Notably, I received an offer from AvantCredit also based on knowledge of statistics and from having an internal referral, so I don’t know if I will end up having enough experience to interview well at other companies.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What would I have done differently, if I could start over?</h2>
I wish I was able to more quickly identify that grad school and law school wouldn’t pan out and therefore not “waste” the time studying for and doing the GRE and LSAT. There definitely were warning signs I could have seen respectively if I had spent more time comparing the careers to my other options. Also, I could have seen the lack of good graduate school programs and the problem with having unrealistic expectations about the kind of LSAT scores I could achieve.

On the other hand, I’d be worried that heuristics that would have saved me time via the GRE and the LSAT would also have cut out computer programming, however, as I was also concerned that training in programming quickly was too much of a dream and I wouldn’t know enough fast enough, which turned out to be wrong.

While much less significant of an issue, I also wish I had refined my decision criteria a bit more. The nine factor model I used in this essay actually was an 11-factor model that included “risk” and “cost”, but both of these considerations ended up being unnecessary. Additionally, my thinking in some of the other categories could be refined. I like the five-factor model offered in <a href='http://80000hours.org/blog/280-a-comparison-of-medical-research-and-earning-to-give'>“A Comparison of Medical Research and Earning to Give”</a> and probably would adopt that if making broad comparisons again in the future.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What impact did 80,000 Hours have in this decision process?</h2>
Overall, the existence of 80,000 Hours completely changed my career, but the choice to pursue additional coaching did not further assist in making my decision.

Before I looked into 80,000 Hours, I was pretty intent on pursuing a Ph.D. in political science for a long time, and thought that would be a great career path for me. (I still do think it would be very enjoyable; I just think it’s less impactful than my other options.) Despite engagement with effective altruism, I hadn’t considered that maybe this career path was wasn’t the best route until I had a conversation with William MacAskill. I think 80,000 Hours has done a lot to put the idea of career choice into the general EA zeitgeist. I am nearly certain I would not have spent any time considering the ethics of career choice if 80,000 Hours did not exist.

The actual career advice session was not useful to me, but I suspect this is because I was an unusual case &#8211; (a) I had already come in to the advice session having done a significant amount of research on my own that I would have done otherwise; (b) I was already very familiar with 80,000 Hours’s content having read all of their research material, completed a workshop with them, and worked in their office; and (c) my particular decision most hinged on very particular details about salaries and career capital that no one had done comprehensive research on yet.

On the other hand, the workshop I had completed for 80,000 Hours was impactful because it moved me away from thinking solely about the impact of my career and more about thinking about the skills and career capital I would develop in my career, which I agree <a href='http://80000hours.org/blog/237-your-career-is-like-a-startup'>is a better model for thinking about careers</a>. Additionally, the conversations I had with people working for 80,000 Hours -- Jess Whittlestone, Roman Duda, William Macaskill, Benjamin Todd, Nick Beckstead, and Pablo Stafforini -- as a part of my personal research were all helpful in thinking more about my career choice. Therefore, I strongly suspect that a careers advising session with 80,000 Hours would be beneficial to many people thinking about their careers.

Ultimately, I did heavily rely on research done by 80,000 Hours to inform my decision &#8211; both in assisting my initial selection of high-impact options and in comparing them. The existence of 80,000 Hours moved me away from pursuing a Ph.D. program in political science toward earning to give in web development. 80,000 Hours very much impacted my decision.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/interview-with-jon-behar/">"Interview with Jon Behar"</a>.</i>

Jon Behar left a lucrative job at the investment management firm to pursue dreams of running philanthropic projects. Behar runs a startup called "A Path That's Clear" which uses a model called "Giving Games". These games are run at colleges and other areas around the world and engage people in discussions about effective giving.

Rob Wiblin and I sat down to interview Jon Behar and learn more about Giving Games. Here's what we learned:

<ul>
<li>"Giving Games" are a way to get people engaged in discussing effective philanthropy by asking them to chose where to give a pot of money from two pre-selected choices</li>
<li>These games can be used to experimentally test why people don't give more effectively and find ways to encourage them to give more and give better</li>
<li>Donating to Giving Games could be an option to leverage an existing donation to a <a href="http://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> top charity.</li>
</ul><!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>How would you describe <a href="http://www.apaththatsclear.com/">"A Path That's Clear"</a>? What does it do?</b>

Our mission is simple and consistent with the mission of "Giving What We Can" - encouraging people to both give more generously and more effectively than they otherwise would. I aim to accomplish this by running "Giving Games", which is just a very simple way to engage people in conversations about effective giving. We gather people together and have a conversation about which charity they would like to give to from a few pre-selected options. The group is also given real funds to make a real donation, which gives participants a sense of ownership over the decision and also engages them in a conversation that encourages them to take a strategic approach to giving.

So far we've run about 25 Giving Games, most of which have taken place at colleges, though several were online and in other settings.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What makes this model appealing?</b>

I see the model as a way to experimentally test why people fail to give effectively and see if we can find any methods to get them onto giving effectively. A Path That's Clear can test these things as hypotheses. Maybe people are afraid of putting up their own money? Well A Path That's Clear provides the money needed to make the decision. Maybe people don't have easy access to high-quality information on effective charities? A Path That's Clear can provide that information. Maybe people just think that "charity begins at home"? We can test that by running a Giving Game with a local non-profit and a non-profit working in the developing world.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What are some of the results of the Giving Games?</b>

Right now, we're looking at the decisions players make to see if they actually give to more effective charities and see if they are thinking more about strategic giving. We do this through post-game surveys that ask players about their experiences and then also by getting feedback from the moderator of the Game.

The actual results of the Games are encouraging - in nearly all the games, the players have selected the more effective charity. But more importantly, players are indicating that their experience in the Game has changed how they think about philanthropy; they resolve to do more research and think about impact the next time they personally give.

We've also taken audio recordings of the Giving Games so I can listen in and the conversation flows freely. One of the driving factors for this is that we're not just getting a random group together, but rather a group with lots of existing social ties (club, sports team, dorm room floor, class) that are already comfortable with each other.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>How has the model changed, if at all, in response to these trials?</b>

We started out pitting the <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a> against, not another charity, but rather the option of letting players keep the money themselves. In this game, people chose AMF, but this decision was probably too obvious and the discussion was not as deep as we would have hoped. Once we decided to make the conversation about two different effective charities or about testing critical notions like "giving begins at home", we found the conversations started really going somewhere.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What's your plan for scaling this up? Who are you going to target? And what is your plan for making this sustainable?</b>

In the long-term, I'd like to institutionalize this process at as many schools, universities, and workplaces as I can, though our main focus is on colleges and universities. I want to embed this conversation about how one can do the most good and make this part of the college experience.

We ran a Giving Game at Brandeis University with 25 students as part of their orientation process. That could serve as a pilot to hopefully making the Giving Game or this type of discussion part of the welcoming process of all students. I have started to very recently partner with <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">The Life You Can Save</a> to run Giving Games under their brand. I also have a few other leads and I'm optimistic we'd be able to get other donors out there. Lastly, I also intend to run an experiment soon with some economists at George Mason University who study giving behaviour. We'll do a Giving Game in a laboratory setting without a social component, because the social component makes it very difficult to control for variables. We're going to try and test some of the really basic assumptions of the model.

What's nice about the model is that anyone can run a Giving Game. Any donor who wants to leverage their giving by running a Giving Game can do so. I want to encourage as many people as possible to take the idea and run with it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>How do you intend to pay this? Including costs of running?</b>

Initially I'd been funding this out of pocket, but I'm excited about this partnership with The Life You Can Save which opens up a lot more resources. I think that the bulk of the cost will be covered by donations, especially once we get up to scale. Luckily, I think there are a lot of people who would potentially donate to Giving Games. Anyone who is already thinking of donating to a GiveWell top charity can accomplish the exact same donation while also funding us, basically for free, leveraging their impact.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Does the amount of money on the table affect things?</b>

Not much. It does need to meet some sort of threshold to get people interested, usually in the $50 to $250 range. However, in an activities fair, for example, even asking people to decide about a dollar was enough to get them to engage.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What would cause you to give up with Giving Games? Do you have an exit strategy?</b>

Ultimately, the hope is that we'll get people to give more and give better. I need to trust the data to see if we actually do that. If we do five experiments and they all indicate that Giving Games turn people into, say, selfish misanthropic people, I need to respect that. I want to be very conscious as we're setting up the impact measuring systems to measure both the potential positive impacts and the potential negative impacts as well. Therefore, I think we need to get better at systematically measuring our actual impact. The surveys we have in place are nice, but then you have to trust self-reports, and our surveys aren't long-term enough. The logistics here are difficult because we're talking about people in their teens and twenties and we care about how people will give over the next 60+ years.

Something I'd like to do is to get some actual donation tracking set-up, but this introduces privacy concerns. The bottom line is that we're going to have to come up with clever ways to get real-time windows into those long-term dynamics. I think this will be a continual process of ramping up and it will really be ongoing, basically have already been started in the past. The experiment at George Mason that I mentioned earlier will be a big step in the right direction and hopefully even this coming academic year we'll have significantly more ability to measure what we're doing.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>What do you think is the greatest weakness of the approach?</b>

I think there's a potential for crowding out. There is the problem of people giving better but giving less, which is a consistent finding in the existing literature. My gut feeling is that it is not going to be an issue and crowding out will be quite minimal because you're concerned about crowding out not in the immediate aftermath, but rather over the participants' lifetimes. Given that most participants have a positive reaction to the game, I don't expect it to be a big issue, but it merits closer investigation and hopefully the George Mason experiment will shed light on that.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Have you had any success getting people to become Giving What We Can members or <a href="http://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a> members through the games?</b>

Occasionally we <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-06-02/how-giving-games-can-spread-the-word-about-smarter-charity-choices-0">run Giving Games through Giving What We Can chapters</a> where the chapter reaches out to random groups of students and asks them to participate. Generally, we've found that this does get those random people interested in participating in their local GWWC Chapter. But we don't have any evidence further than that and we don't know anyone who's taken the Pledge as a result of a Giving Game.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Can other people get involved in "A Path That's Clear"? If so, how?</b>

They can email info@apaththatsclear.com or get in touch through the contact us form. We love to get inquiries and we're eager to talk to folks and get people as involved as we can.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.montchrishubbard.com/blog/thegift.html">A profile of Zell Kravinsky</a>.  Any biography that opens casually with "Last summer, not long after [he] had given almost his entire forty-five-million-dollar real-estate fortune to charity" has to be good.

And speaking of effective altruism, ever wonder what characteristics effective altruists share?  Joey Savoie and Xio Kikauka <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/07/ea-interview-project.html">interviewed 42 EAs</a> and found an average age of 25 (17-46), 75% male, left-wing politics, an average of 20 hours a week on EA volunteering, donating a median of 10% of their income, and generally transitioned from altruism to EA (as opposed to from effectiveness to EA).  Though, admittedly, this survey used a non-random convenience sample.

Also, <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/260949.html">we <i>should</i> put a value on a human life</a>: "That dollar value is $5.8 million. Denying this leads to terrible consequences. Let me explain."<!--more-->

***

Some failures of people doing science:

<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/02/two-dark-side-statistics-papers/">How statistics can go wrong</a> and basically say anything the author wants them to say.

<a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/jacobs/on-intellectual-triage-and-not-writing-people-off/">"On Intellectual Triage and Not Writing People Off"</a>: "Terry Eagleton’s bludgeoning review of Richard Dawkins’s The God Delusion famously begins, 'Imagine someone holding forth on biology whose only knowledge of the subject is the Book of British Birds, and you have a rough idea of what it feels like to read Richard Dawkins on theology.' I share Eagleton’s frustration. But what doesn’t bother me — or Eagleton either, I’m pretty sure — is Dawkins’s rejection of religious belief in general or Christianity in particular. Suppose Dawkins were to say something like this: 'I don’t really know that much about Christianity, but from what I do know I haven’t seen anything that would cause me to take it seriously or to investigate it further.' I would have absolute respect for that position — because, after all, that’s the position I’m in in relation to all sorts of beliefs: in Zoroastrianism, say, or telekinesis, or alien spacecraft in Roswell, New Mexico."

<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/j8/the_crackpot_offer/">"The Crackpot Offer</a>: "The thought went through my mind:  'I'll get that theorem eventually!  Someday I'll disprove Cantor's Diagonal Argument, even though my first try failed!'  I resented the theorem for being obstinately true, for depriving me of my fame and fortune, and I began to look for other disproofs.  And then I realized something.  I realized that I had made a mistake, and that, now that I'd spotted my mistake, there was absolutely no reason to suspect the strength of Cantor's Diagonal Argument any more than other major theorems of mathematics.  I saw then very clearly that I was being offered the opportunity to become a math crank, and to spend the rest of my life writing angry letters in green ink to math professors."

However, a way to make things a bit better -- advance science.  From <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/130-three-ways-to-advance-science">"Three Ways to Advance Science":</a> "There are three ways to contribute to scientific progress. The direct way is to conduct a good scientific study and publish the results. The indirect way is to help others make a direct contribution. Journal editors, university administrators and philanthropists who fund research contribute to scientific progress in this second way. A third approach is to marry the first two and make a scientific advance that itself expedites scientific advances. The full significance of this third way is commonly overlooked."

***

<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/20/social-justice-for-the-highly-demanding-of-rigor/">"Social Justice for the Highly Demanding of Rigor"</a>:  Some people claim "that social justice advocates irresponsibly take some undesirable outcome in minority groups, like poverty, and then assume it is the result of racism or sexism without considering other possible explanations. [...] My counterargument is that although the first argument is true a depressingly large amount of the time, some people do more rigorous work and get the same result – that poor outcomes for minority groups are caused in large part by racism and sexism."

***

Exactly as the title says: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/">"Anatomy of a Hack: How Crackers Ransack Passwords Like 'qeadzcwrsfxv1331'"</a>. Ars Technica gave three experts a 16,000-entry encrypted password file, and asked them to break them. The winner got 90% of them <i>in a few hours</i>.  And this includes passwords like "momof3gr8kds" and <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">"correcthorsebatterystaple"</a>. If you want to make a secure password, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-246.html">use the Schneier Scheme</a>.

***

Paul Graham on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html">"How to Not Die" (as a business)</a>.  This is why <a href="http://www.dotimpact.im">.impact</a> has <a href="http://dotimpact.im/meetings.html">weekly meetings</a> -- weekly meetings encourage a powerful norm of weekly progress, which moves things forward: "You've probably noticed that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders causes you to get more done than you would otherwise[. ...] Every dinner is [...] a deadline. [...T]he mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will push you to make things happen, because otherwise you'll be embarrassed to tell us that you haven't done anything new since the last time we talked."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I haven't been writing as much as I used to, but one thing I have started getting interested in is writing about "not utilitarianism".  Thus, I've thought it easiest to start a new blog elsewhere: <b><a href="http://peterhurford.tumblr.com">peterhurford.tumblr.com</a></b>

I’m on Tumblr as a matter of economy — it seemed like a quick and easy way to make a blog happen without mucking around in Wordpress or Jeckyll or what not.  It will be for all my musings that aren't philosophical-y or utilitarian-y enough to go on his *real* blog. But I promise this all maximizes utility somehow...

<b>Rest assured, I'll still be keeping this blog going.</b>  But sometimes, I'll have things that are best said elsewhere.  And now I have an elsewhere to say those things.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Periodically, in times of blog inactivity, I like to come back and report all the things I've been doing while not blogging.  Here's a complete run down of the more recent:

<b>I finished up Recruitment for my fraternity.</b>  It was basically working a part-time 20hrs/wk job for two weeks doing lots of event planning, but we ended up getting twelve fine men to join our fraternity.  Well worth it!

<b>I've been working with Ozzie Gooen on <a href="http://www.dotimpact.im">.impact</a></b>, a distributed volunteer force working to produce really useful projects.  Here's <a href="https://impact.hackpad.com/Projects-aRiPtncmuKS">a list of projects our group is working on</a> and you can check <a href="http://dotimpact.im/meetings.html">our meetings log</a> for their status.  Besides helping coordinate the group as a whole, I'm also working on building a <a href="http://www.jobboard.im">Job Board</a> (<a href="https://impact.hackpad.com/Job-Board-G2ZocnkVTsc">more details here</a>) and <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/peterhurford.com/document/d/1nA3VYi3-UbAOefSWCNcFQQ2fTIceiX1CkyZMIHO-q2Q/edit">studying vegetarian advocacy</a>.

<b>I've been working on learning more computer programming.</b>  In addition to working on the Job Board, I've begun to work for a friend's startup called <a href="http://www.jorgestradingpost.com">Jorge's Trading Post</a>, doing some PHP development for them.  I've also been learning more Ruby on Rails, Python, and JavaScript.  It helps that I'm now in a Computer Science class and have to program for actual homework.<!--more-->

<b>I have been blogging, some.</b>  I've posted around here, but I've also been posting non-utilitarian stuff (gasp!) on <a href="http://peterhurford.tumblr.com">my Tumblr</a>.

<b>I'm still doing Senior Research.</b>  I'm researching political optimism and the influence of optimism on political behavior.  We just launched our survey recently on <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon's Mechanical Turk</a>.

<b>I'm still <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1024">debating Alonzo Fyfe</a>.</b>  The topic is whether Alonzo Fyfe’s desirism or my two-level utilitarianism is the better theory of utilitarianism.

<b>I'm still involved in the <a href="http://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/service-opportunities/dca">Denison Community Association</a></b>, the umbrella organization for all volunteer service and service learning on Denison's campus.  I'm currently working to figure out how to get more people involved in service.

<b>I'm still involved in <a href="https://orgsync.com/custom_pages/10460/show/8585">Denison Venture Philanthropy</a></b>, a grant-making organization that gives out $10K and 200 volunteer hours to one non-profit each year.  This year, we're working with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/southnewark">South Newark Civic Association</a> to (1) get them a professional website, (2) do a survey-based needs analysis of the community, and (3) put together a booklet of local businesses.  I'm helping work on the website -- not programming, but helping them figure out how to talk to vendors.

<b>I'm still volunteering with <a href="http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>.</b>  Recently, <a href="http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/ace-highlight-organization-evaluation-criteria/">I helped put together</a> some detailed <a href="http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/organization-evaluation-template/">organization evaluation criteria</a> that ACE will use to evaluate organizations going forward.

<b>I'm going to be giving a 12-minute <a href="https://www.ted.com/tedx">TEDx talk</a></b> on <a href="http://www.givewell.org/giving101">effective giving</a> at <a href="http://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/whats-happening/tedxdenisonu">TEDxDenisonU</a> on the 1st of March.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Could EA Community Building be an Easy and Underfunded Win?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is a lot of effort in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">effective altruist movement</a> right now.  Community building would include anything broadly related to recruitment and retention for the EA movement, aiming to get existing EAs to become more EA (and less likely to quit EA) as well as getting new people to become EA.  This seems <i>prima facie</i> to be very high impact for many classical reasons like the <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration">haste consideration</a> that recruiting one person now seems to double your impact.

However, not too much EA effort seems channeled into community building at the moment.  <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://www.80000hours.org/">80K Hours</a>, <a href="http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>, and <a href="http://www.intelligence.org">the Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> are all primarially research organizations.  Organizations like 80K Hours and ACE once were outreach / community building organizations, but then intentionally rebranded and refocused specifically on research, eschewing community building.  GiveWell has considered many times to improve effort put into marketing, and chosen not to.<!--more-->

As far as community building goes, we have <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> and <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">The Life You Can Save</a> doing individual and mass marketing respectively for trying to convince people to help the extremely poor.  We also have the <a href="http://www.rationality.org">Centre for Applied Rationality</a> providing outreach and rationality training.  And <a href="http://www.leverageresearch.org/">Leverage Research</a> has provided some work, creating <a href="http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/">THINK</a> for recruitment and the <a href="http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com/">EA Summit</a> for retention/unification.  There are also several independently-organized meetup groups.

It just seems like there could be more here.  While there are many EA meetup groups, no one seems to be doing much work to figure out how to scale this approach to create many more groups in many more areas, or spreading best practices between the groups.  The amount of EA outreach that is not focused on global poverty seems really minimal.  The community building that is done seems like it could grow far more in sophistication, especially in terms of measurement, transparency of that measurement, and improving based upon those results.

All of these ideas seem like easy wins that are currently underfunded in both time and effort.

I'm not sure at the moment how far this analysis goes.  I haven't put much thought into comparing the marginal impact of more research versus more community building.  I also imagine groups have pivoted away from community building for a good reason -- I just don't know what that reason is.

Anyone have any ideas?

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think coordinated EA building moves would be very valuable. There are many resources I would like to have which are not there.

I recently took over running the EA Melbourne from Brayden and Ryan, and they have done something incredible. Seven months ago there was nothing, and now is definitely a recurring membership base who attend events. It is clearly possible to get something going.

Still, there are challenges and limitations to be overcome. Currently half of attendance at events are members of our LW group rather than newly recruited EAs. Some of the LW attendees have admitted they come for the social element of all their friends being there rather than a strong interest in EA.

My major goal is to get to a point where the community is self-sustaining, particularly by finding individuals who are at least as committed and capable as myself, Brayden, Ryan, or Helen. This is vital since Brayden and Ryan have moved away from Melbourne, and Helen and I are likely to do so in the future.
Currently I would fear that all activity would stop if we were to leave.

As far as resources go, I currently feel that we're on our own and not in contact or sharing resources with any other EA community groups (even though they exist - yesterday I stumbled upon the Harvard EA group). Valuable things would include a network of the local EA groups with organiser communication, high-quality, tested introductory advertising materials such as introductory descriptions of EA and EA groups, logos and branding, pamphlet templates, business card design, content selection for meetups, directory of high profile EAs who have agreed to present via Skype and have prepared talks, collection of EA youtube videos/TedTalks (e.g. recent David Pollota one).

Ensuring that meetup content is accessible and suitable for newcomers is something which thoughts need to be put into. I was hesitant to invite our EA community en mass to a recent talk with an international LW/EA for fear it would lead to discussion of X-risk or even just the far future, which just too many inferential steps for a new EA just grappling with the ideas and implications of effectiveness.

The recently started Sunday Assembly group has very tight coordination of community building and provision of resources. Branding is in fact enforced to be consistent across global chapters along with many other requirements to keep the chapters consistent. This may or may not be appropriate for EA, but the effort is noteworthy.

I will write this up properly and insert it into the document linked above soon But yes, this is a good idea.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Peter,

I think doing research can be a good way to community build. For instance, I think GiveWell has done a lot to 'build the EA community.'

I also think 80k contributes directly to community building by engaging people about their careers, which gives them reason to think about effective altruism more broadly. We also build a community through our coaching, because we use it to introduce like-minded people, and we're building an alumni network that could do cool stuff in the future.

I'm not denying there's more that could be done in community building, just pointing out that it's not fair to say 80k isn't doing community building or is neglecting its value.

I wasn't calling 80K out.  Instead, I thought that 80K had "shifted away" from community building (e.g., put less effort into overt/direct community building and more effort elsewhere, like research) and probably for important strategic reasons unknown to me.  I see that the power of indirect community building via research is one of those reasons that I had not considered.]]></wp:comment_content>

				<title>How Do The Extremely Poor Live?</title>
		<link>http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-do-the-extremely-poor-live/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What is it like to be extremely poor?

We know that the extremely poor are living on less than what $1.25 a day could buy in the United States.  But this seems implausible.  Wouldn’t someone with that little money just end up dying of starvation very quickly?  Simulations like <a href="https://www.livebelowtheline.com/">Living Below the Line</a> can only go so far.  It’s difficult to understand what it’s like to be that poor.

However, it’s now becoming a bit easier to understand.  Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo, authors of the popular book <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938">Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty</a></b> and co-founders of <a href="http://www.povertyactionlab.org/">The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab</a>, have written a paper called <a href="http://economics.mit.edu/files/530">“The Economic Lives of the Poor”</a>.  Using survey data from thirteen different countries, Banerjee and Duflo are able to tell the tale of life as a poor person.

Here's an informative summary of their research.<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
[caption id="attachment_1243" align="aligncenter" width="383"]<img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-1.23.26-AM.png" alt="An extremely poor village in Kenya" width="383" height="288" class="size-full wp-image-1243" /> An extremely poor village in Kenya[/caption]

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Families Compared</h2>
The typical extremely poor households tends to be much larger than a US family.  The extremely poor households have a median of 8 people living in them, compared to 2.5 in the US.  However, it’s not typically a couple with many children like one might expect -- there actually is a median of 3 adults in a household.  This suggests a family structure where people live with their parents, siblings, uncles, cousins, etc., which makes sense given it is easier to pool resources when you are sharing a space.

However, poor households do have more children than US households, having about 3 children per woman of child-bearing age, as compared to 1.9 in the US or 1.6 in Europe.  The population of extremely poor areas is also very young in general.  While the US has about one young person (age below 18) for every old person (age above 51), extremely poor areas have a median of six young people for every old person.

This helps to explain why interventions targeted on children, such as school deworming, can have a large impact on the future of these countries - most of the population is young. It also helps to explain higher rates of violence or political instability in poor countries, as violence everywhere is overwhelmingly committed by young men according to Steven Pinker’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Better-Angels-Our-Nature/dp/1455883115"><b>Better Angels of Our Nature</b></a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Being Extremely Poor Like?</h2>
One of the most common traits of being extremely poor is weakness and disease.  Because of low food consumption and poor nutrition, 65% of the poor in Udaipur, India (the area with the best data) are underweight.

43% of the adults report having difficulty with “activities of daily living”, and this includes 34% of adults under 50.  Furthermore, 55% of the poor have an insufficient red blood cell count (anemia).  In the last month, 72% of the poor in Udaipur report at least one symptom of a disease and 46% of the poor report seeing a doctor because of a disease.

Despite constant sickness, self-reported levels of health and happiness are not particularly low, but self-reported levels of stress (both financial and psychological) are very high.

Furthermore, infant mortality is still high.  Surveys have asked women about the outcomes of their pregnancies, including whether the child is still alive.  Infant mortality is the number of children who die before reaching their first birthday, as a percentage of the number of live births.  Among the poor, this number is at a low of 3.4% in Indonesia and a high of 16.7% in Pakistan, compared to 0.5% in Europe.  Notably, these numbers are likely to be underestimates because not all children are remembered, especially if they die very early.

<h2>What Do the Poor Eat?</h2>
The typical poor person could spend about 30% more on food if they wanted to, cutting out all other spending and all savings.  Also, the poor don’t buy food optimally.  In a surveyed region of India, the cheapest way to eat (in terms of calories per dollar) was to buy the grain "millet".  However, in this region, only about two-thirds of food spending was on millet, with another 20% on rice (which costs about twice as much per calorie), another 10% on wheat (70% more expensive than millets per calorie), and almost 7% on sugar (which is the most expensive per calorie and has no other nutritional value).  I don't know if this is true of other areas, though.

Despite having more ability to buy food, the poor don’t eat much -- the households in the bottom 10% of  per capita expenditure consume less than 1400 calories a day on average, which is about half of what is recommended for a man with moderate activity, or a woman with heavy physical activity.

Furthermore, going without food is quite common.  In Udaipur, 45% of poor households reported adults cutting the size of their meal and 12% of households reported children having to cut the size of their meal as well.  In addition, 37% of poor households in Udaipur reported going without a meal for an entire day within the last year.

GiveDirectly, one of GiveWell’s top charities that gives cash transfers to the extremely poor, notes that in their target area of Kenya, “well over half of adults skip meals, less than half of household members eat until they are content, people commonly go to sleep hungry, and a paltry 18% report having enough food for tomorrow”.

One type of food that is frequently bought in South India is a dosa, or a rice and beans pancakes that almost everyone eats for breakfast.  This can be bought frequently for a rupee, which is approximately 15 US cents (PPP adjusted).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Do the Poor Buy?</h2>
One might expect that an extremely poor person is working as hard as they can just to survive, putting every penny earned toward food.  However, this actually isn’t the case -- across the thirteen countries studied, food only accounted for 56% to 78% of the budget.

So what do the poor spend money on instead?  Surprisingly, spending on education is very low -- typically about 2% of budgets.  This is mostly because governments provide free schooling.  In every country sampled except Cote d’Ivoire, at least 50% of boys and girls aged 7 to 12 were in school.  Unfortunately, there’s mounting evidence that the public schools aren’t that good.

A lot of spending varies region to region, but a typical extremely poor person spends about 4.1% to 8.1% of their budget on tobacco and alcohol.  Furthermore, in every region except South America, around 10% of the budget was devoted to festivals, like weddings, funerals, or religious celebrations.

Why would the poor spend money on entertainment at the cost of more essential items?  One possibility is that more food wouldn’t help, because they would just end up getting weak from contracting disease later on.

Another possibility is that entertainment is a strongly felt need that provides an escape from thinking about economic problems. Festivals and similar events also contribute to social bonds that are very important to everyone, but particularly those in poverty who live in riskier environments and more frequently require support from their connections to deal with financial or other difficulties.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Does a Poor Person Own?</h2>
Even among the extremely poor, above 70% of households in South Africa and Peru owned a radio (though only 11% of the poor in Udaipur had a radio).  Furthermore, while no one in Udaipur had a television, in Guatemala, nearly a quarter of households had a television and in Nicaragua almost half of the households did.

The poor generally don’t own many productive assets, but some do have some land.  While only 1.4% of the poor in South Africa and 4% of the poor in Mexico own land, 65% of the poor in Guatemala, 85% of the poor in Panama, and 99% of the poor in Udaipur have land.  Unfortunately, most of this land is dry scrubland that cannot be used for agriculture throughout most of the year.  Furthermore, it’s not much land -- a typical household’s plot, if they have land at all, is about one hectare (100m x 100m or 2.4 acres), which is small for a farm.

Other goods that could be used for productivity are in short supply.  In nearly all the areas surveyed, less than 14% of poor households owned a bicycle.  Less than 1% of poor households had sewing machines, bullock cart, motorized cycle, or tractor.  Houses are also pretty sparse.  Banerjee and Duflo’s data showed that while most households had at least one bed or cot, only 10% had a chair or stool and only 5% had a table.  However, <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/site-visits/november-2012#GiveDirectly">GiveWell’s site visit of Give Directly’s targeted areas</a> in Kenya showed that living rooms they saw typically had many chairs, tables, and couches and that most homes owned a bicycle, but few houses had radios or television.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
The poor also tend to lack access to basic infrastructure, but it is highly variable.  Access to water varies from a minimum of 0% in Udaipar to 36% in Guatemala.  Electricity varies from 1.3% in Tanzania to 99% in Mexico.  Access to toilets range from 0% in Udaipur to 100% in Nicaragua.  Moreover, infrastructure doesn’t always appear together.  While 97% of poor households in Indonesia have electricity, only 6% have tap water.

GiveWell anecdotally noted that of the fifteen households they visited, most homes had three rooms -- a sitting room, bedroom, and storage room -- varying in size from 10’x12’ to 12’x20’ each.  Generally, the husband and wife would sleep in the bedroom and the children would often sleep in the storage room.  Houses frequently would have a separate kitchen structure.

GiveWell also observed that people would hang old calendars (like from 2003) for decoration and used kerosene lamps for light because there was no electricity.  They also heard that people walk about 5-20 minutes daily to obtain drinking water.  Furthermore, they observed people owning about 1-2 cows and 4-5 chickens for livestock.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Do Poor People Get Money?</h2>
About 50% of the poor living in Indonesia, 72% in Cote d’Ivoire, 84% in Guatemala, and 94% in Udaipur report working multiple jobs in order to get their income -- typically one agricultural and one non-agricultural, though not always.

Most non-agricultural jobs involve self-employment as a business owner.  Typically, a member of the poor household will migrate (about 60% of families), leaving for a median of one month to find employment in a nearby city.  Others will perform a job earlier in the day, like selling food, and then go out and perform another job, like selling textiles, collect trash, or general labor.

Generally these entrepreneurial jobs done by the poor do not require skills.  In Hyderabad, jobs of the poor breakdown to 17% general stores, 11% tailors, 8% fruit and vegetable sellers, 6.6% telephone booth operators, 6.3% milk sellers, and 4.3% auto owners.  Of these, only tailoring requires a specialized skill that takes awhile to acquire.

Additionally, about 76% of the poor report at least one member of their household working for a public employment program.  Many governments provide safety-net “food for work” programs, which entitle some days of physical labor under government employment at a pre-announced, low wage.  Unfortunately, this kind of work is rare and is often given out in a way that discriminates against the poor.

Another interesting question is how the poor would spend additional money, if they got it.  GiveDirectly, by giving cash transfers in $1000 chunks, has been able to find out.  An informal survey conducted by them and shared with GiveWell found that 67% of the money spent went into home improvement (replacing a thatched roof with an iron-sheet roof), 9% went to other (like school uniforms or a motorcycle), 9% went to livestock, and 4% went to food.  However, this survey was only in Kenya, and other areas might spend differently.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Do the Poor Save and Get Credit?</h2>
Typically, the poor don’t actually have access to a safe place to save money at a reasonable rate of return.  Only 14% of poor households have a savings account (with the exception of Cote d’Ivoire, where the number is 79%).  Even stashing cash in a pillow or a home doesn’t work well because of high inflation and rates of theft.  Additionally, the poor, like everyone else, have problems resisting the temptation to spend money they have at hand, both when family members demand access to it, or when given the option to buy the same indulgences people in developed countries struggle to resist.

There also is little access to insurance.  Less than 6% of the poor have access to any kind of health insurance.  Generally, insurance is instead provided through friends and relatives as a type of loan exchange -- 75% of poor households report making loans, 65% report borrowing money, and 50% report both.  The most common form of “insurance” to handle economic stress is eating less, taking children out of school, and foregoing medical treatment.

This lack of insurance or saving leads the poor to under-invest because they cannot accumulate financial assets, or afford to take risks.  Poor families do not specialize in skills and they operate their businesses at a remarkably small scale.  Poor families have access to very limited markets and infrastructure and suffer from a lack of access to credit.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Overall, a life in extreme poverty is one that can be endured and survived, but still not one that is particularly fun.   A life in this kind of poverty is a life without basic utilities, food security, and without many possessions we take for granted.  Instead, it’s a life of malnutrition, disease, and unpredictability.

However, it’s not quite as terrible as it sounds.  The extremely poor people still smile, still laugh, and still play.  They put money into their families and their festivals.  They still appear to be happy, for the most part.   Their lives still contain joy.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Some people have told me that it’s pointless to try and cure the extremely poor of malaria, because this means that they’ll just continue their miserable lives and catch a new disease a few months later, and die from that.  However, this is contradicted by the evidence.  Curing people of malaria still allows them to live a better life than they otherwise would and helps contribute to the economic development necessary to make things better.  And people who survive beyond their fifth birthday <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/additional/Standard-of-Living#MortalityandMorbiditywhatarethemajorhealthproblemsinthedevelopingworld">are more likely than not to live a full life</a>.

As GiveWell writes in <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2007/12/04/what-a-life-saved-means/">"What a ‘Life Saved’ Means"</a>: 

<blockquote>maybe the life you saved is a life without iPhones, but we’re still talking about a person who, at the very least, can be expected to grow up, make friends, fall in love, get in arguments, watch the sunset, have ups and downs, etc.”  I agree.  I’d never say things “aren’t that bad”, because they are.  Things are bad.  But not impossible.</blockquote>

We can turn things around, and we should.

As this article provides an entry-level overview, it is obvious that not all points can be covered in great detail.

The question on whether or not the extremely poor spend their money wisely is quite important for possible donors. Pretty much everyone knows poor people which could easily be more wealthy by managing their finances more rationally. I for instance am much more inclined to help someone who is poor due to external circumstances than to help someone who is poor due to bad (and consistently bad) life choices.

That being said it might surprise most people, that someone who starves spends as much as 10% of his income on "entertainment activities". That this might ultimately be a rational way to spend money is an important point to make and was - in my opinion - made quite clear.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think characterizing things like funerals and religious festivals as "entertainment" is not the best term.  When you think about it, it may not be that surprising that people with difficult lives still want to prioritize the observation of major life events and holidays that perhaps give some relief from the difficulty of everyday life.  Especially if there's a cultural understanding that this is what decent people do, and to neglect such occasions would be considered offensive or indecent.  

Good article in general, Peter.  

Question about millet - presumably the cheapest staple varies a lot by area?  I assume rice is the cheapest staple in much of Asia, for example?  Also, before publishing more widely, you might want to change "millets" to "millet".  It's like "wheat" - it doesn't take a plural ending.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<b>Julia:</b> "I think characterizing things like funerals and religious festivals as “entertainment” is not the best term."

I agree.  I was following the terms established by the article.

~

<b>Julia:</b> "When you think about it, it may not be that surprising that people with difficult lives still want to prioritize the observation of major life events and holidays that perhaps give some relief from the difficulty of everyday life."

I agree.  Poor people are human too, and they smoke and drink just like the rest of us.  I think the article (and my summary) does capture this response -- I do admit that "[a]nother possibility is that entertainment is a strongly felt need that provides an escape from thinking about economic problems".

But I think there is an interesting paradox that the extremely poor are willing to give up even the most basic things we take for granted (e.g., food) for their festivals.  Interesting not in the sense that these poor people are weird, but in that our rich perspective doesn't account for it well.

~

<b>Julia:</b> Question about millet – presumably the cheapest staple varies a lot by area? I assume rice is the cheapest staple in much of Asia, for example?

I'm not sure.  The source article I was summarizing seems to suggest millet categorically across all areas.  To investigate further, I looked at the article the source article cited for the claim, <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/The_Demand_for_Food_and_Calories.pdf" rel="nofollow">"The Demand for Food and Calories" (Subramanian & Deaton, 1996)</a> and the cited article made the claim only for a particular region of India.

I'll update the claim of the article.

~

<b>Julia:</b> Also, before publishing more widely, you might want to change “millets” to “millet”. It’s like “wheat” – it doesn’t take a plural ending.

Will fix.  Thanks!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Over at Felicifia, Alonzo Fyfe, blogger at <a href="http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/">Atheist Ethicist</a> and <a href="http://secularite.com/real-world-ethics-alonzo-fyfe/">The Secularite</a>, and I <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1024">had a debate</a> on "Which is a better theory of utilitarianism -- Alonzo Fyfe's desirism or Peter Hurford's two-level utilitarianism?".  I wanted to reprint that debate here.  Here's the first entry (of eight).  This entry was written by Alonzo Fyfe.</i>

-

I want to defend the claim that desirism (desire utilitarianism) is the best form of utilitarianism - better even than Peter Hurford's version of RM Hare's two-level theory. 

I wish to start by explaining its differences from other utilitarian theories and suggesting how these make desirism stronger than those other theories.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Types of Utilitarianism</h2>
There are two ways to cut utilitarian theories.

<b>Types of Utility:</b> On this first cut, we distinguish what counts as utility. Candidates include pleasure and freedom from pain (Jeremy Bentham), happiness over unhappiness (John Stuart Mills), preference satisfaction (Peter Singer), and the well-being of conscious creatures (Sam Harris). 

<b>Objects of Evaluation:</b> This second cut looks at primary objects of evaluation. Act utilitarianism makes the evaluation of actions primary - do that act that maximizes utility. Rule utilitarianism makes a rule set primary - do that act that conforms to the best rule set, where the best rule set maximizes utility. 

These two cuts go across each other, allowing for possibilities such as happiness maximizing rule utilitarianism (Mill) or preference satisfaction act utilitarianism (Singer). 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Desires as the Primary Object of Evaluation</h2>
Desirism (desire utilitarianism) holds that desires are the primary object of evaluation. On this account, the right act is the act that conforms to the best desire set, and the best desire set is the desire set that maximizes utility. 

Many who heard the term “desire utilitarianism” interpreted it as a candidate for the first cut – the right act is the act that maximizes desire fulfillment. Somebody making this mistake may be tempted to argue: "What about a case where a lot of people desire the torture of a young child? Your theory would say that torturing the child is not only right, but obligatory." 

Desirism would not make the act obligatory. It would look at the desire to have a young child tortured and see it as a desire that tends to reduce utility. Imagine that the desire did not exist – there will be little to no reason to introduce it and many and strong reasons not to. As a desire that tends to thwart other desires, it is does not have a place in the best desire set. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Desirism as Modified Rule Utilitarianism</h2>
More specifically, desirism takes rule utilitarianism and physically writes the rules into the structures of brains in the form of desires. In doing this, it avoids the most common objection to rule-utilitarianism - that it collapses into act utilitarianism. 

Imagine a situation where an act that follows the rules (saving an innocent person) produces less utility than an act that breaks the rules (killing an innocent person). These are your choices: Perform the act that conforms to the rules, or perform the act that produces the most utility. 

In many cases, a rule utilitarian can avoid this objection by pointing to the efficiency of following a rule of thumb. Yet, that response does not work in cases where we know which act will maximize utility - and yet still hold that the moral requirement is to do something other than maximize utility. When the child is tortured for the satisfaction of 10,000 sadists, we know which option maximizes utility. 

Considerations of utility alone demand performing the act-utilitarian best act. In order to defend obeying the rules in these circumstances we must introduce a principle that says that following the rules has moral value even when it produces less utility. Requiring that rule-following have value independent of utility abandons utilitarianism. 

However, lets write the rules into brains in ways that do not allow this type of choice. A person can forego fulfilling a particular desire, but only if there are more or stronger desires that outweigh it. To perform the act-utilitarian best act, one must have a different desire set - there is no other option. From here, we can ask what is the overall effect of the desire set that would permit the act-utilitarian best act. 

Specifically, desirism takes rule utilitarianism and adds three elements: 

(1) The rules are not abstract entities - they refer to the potential structures of physical matter (brains). Physical actions can change these structures, and different structures cause different actions. Our question is: Which structures do we have reason to promote? 

(2) The rule sets are inviolable. An individual rule/desire may be broken, but only if outweighed by more or stronger rules/desires stacked against it. 

(3) The rules/desires are persistent, though changeable. The desires present during any action will motivate an agent's actions through a wide variety of circumstances. More importantly, the desires we have reason to promote will exist both across agents and across time. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ethics in Likely versus Exotic/Impossible Situations</h2>
In evaluating the utility of a rule/desire set, we will need to take into account how likely particular situations are. A desire that produces non-utilitarian outcomes in rare or impossible situations would not count against it. 

This allows us to sidestep many proposed “tests” of utilitarianism. They ask us to imagine an unlikely or impossible situation with an obvious act-utilitarian best act that still seems objectionable. Examples include pushing a fat man onto the path of a runaway trolley thus preventing it from killing five people further down the track, or a doctor killing a healthy patient to harvest five organs to save the lives of five patients. 

Desire utilitarianism says that the utility of desires is to be determined by looking at the situations in which they are likely to play a causal role. Morality concerns refusing to drink and drive, keeping promises, paying debts, leaving the money your co-worker has in her purse, refraining from aggressive violence, abstaining from sex without consent, and not killing or maiming people just because you think that some good might come of it. 

A look at the news tells us that we have a far bigger problem with people killing others when they think some good can come of it than we have with people not being killed - be they political or religious ends or simply punishing somebody the killer thinks deserves to be killed. Weakening the aversion to killing based on fantastic unrealistic scenarios would be foolish. That is exactly the effect of saying that no condemnation is due the person who kills when he thinks good can come of it. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Is 'Utility'?</h2>
Desirism not only makes desires the primary object of moral evaluation, it has something to say about what counts as utility. 

Every desire that P, for some proposition P, provides an agent with a motivating reason to realize states of affairs where P is true. 

The desires for pleasure or happiness provide agents with motivating reasons to realize states where "I am experiencing pleasure" or "I am happy" are true. A desire that one's children are safe provides a motivating reason to realize states where, "My children are safe" is true. An aversion lying or breaking promises motivates agents to avoid realizing states where, "I am lying" or "I am breaking a promise" are true. An aversion to having any child go hungry provides a motivating reason to realize states where "no child is hungry" is true. 

The list of propositions P that define our potential desires is as unbounded as the list of propositions P that define our potential beliefs. This means that the list of things that count as utility is not limited to one or two things. The list may be endless. 

Most utilitarian theories that compete against this model fall into one of three groups. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Group 1: Brain-state theories.</h4>

Brain-state theories identify utility with particular brain states - pleasure, happiness, contentment. 

Brain-state theories fail Robert Nozick's experience machine test. Ask parents whether they would prefer to be put into an experience machine that will feed them sensations that their child is healthy and happy - while the child suffers great agony in fact - and the vast majority would refuse. They are not seeking a brain state, they are seeking a world state where their child is, in fact, healthy and happy. The experience machine does not create a state where P is true, so the experience machine does not hold value for the parent with a desire that their child be healthy and happy. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Group 2: Value-laden terms</h4>

Another family of utilitarian theories identifies utility with some value-laden concept such as "well-being" or "the good life". 

The problem with these theories is that they don't really answer the question, "What is good?" They simply push the question back to "What is well-being?" or "What is the good life?" 

Desirism can actually answer questions like, "What is well-being?" However, understanding well-being means understanding that it is not the sole content of utility. 

Desirism identifies well-being is a state of being in which an agent's self-regarding desires are fulfilled. Because such a state realizes some of the things an agent desires, an agent has reason to realize such a state. However, an agent's self-regarding desires are only a subset of the agent's desires. Therefore, well-being is only a subset of what counts as utility. 

Many parents would prefer are a greater loss of well-being for themselves to a lesser loss of well-being for their child. This is because their other-regarding concern for their child is something that parents care about in addition to well-being, so that their child's lesser well-being has more value than their own greater well-being. Such a person would reduce overall well-being, but it does not follow that they are immoral. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Group 3: Intrinsic Value Theories</h4>
Intrinsic value theories tell us that some states have intrinsic value, and intrinsic value must be maximized while intrinsic badness minimized. Group 1 and Group 2 are intrinsic value theories. 

Desirism holds that intrinsic value does not exist. A desire that P creates a motivating reason to realize P, not its intrinsic merit. 

An intrinsic value claim may take the form of saying, for example, all preference satisfaction has equal value, so it is wrong to put one person's preferences above another's. One must consider one's child's preferences as equal to those of another child - as equal to one's own. 

Desirism can give us reason to deny that a preference for the well-being of one's family and friends is immoral. 

A large company seeking only profits will divide its operations into regions, telling each regional director, "You are responsible for this region. In assigning bonuses, for example, do not look at the benefits of giving bonuses to employees in other regions - that is not your job. Look only to your district." 

Similarly, it makes sense to assign each child to an adult and say, "This child is your responsibility. In accepting this responsibility, you are not to treat the interests of each child equally but to concern himself primarily with the interests of this child - leaving others to care for the children assigned to them." 

This would not be an argument against redistribution. An argument can also be made for taking the surplus resources of some families (regional directors) and investing them in a different region where they can do more good. However, is not inconsistent with the demand that individuals take responsibility for their own children, family, friends, and neighbors. 

The value of a desire is not found in its intrinsic merit, but in the reasons that exist for promoting it. In this sense, desires have the same type of value as everything else has - according to its tendency to fulfill or thwart (other) desires. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
My goal here has been to explain the differences between desirism and other forms of utilitarianism in order to highlight its strengths. It is a form of rule utilitarianism that does not collapse into act utilitarianism. As such, it can avoid the objections to act utilitarianism based on exotic cases. Its rules are potential physical entities in the real world. It does not require postulating some type of intrinsic value or any other type of exotic entity. It handles Nozick's experience machine and provides a real-world answer to the question, "What is value?"]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Career Advice for Jacy, Choosing Between Ph.D. Programs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Jacy is an effective altruist trying to decide what career to go into after college.  He's currently choosing between a Ph.D. in neuroscience or a Ph.D. in economics.  He wrote to me asking for advice.  This was my reply.  We both agreed it would be good to publish it so that others thinking about Ph.D. programs can benefit as well.</i>

-

I made you wait a long time for not too much, because I don't know a lot about PhD programs.  So I'll be saying more general things that are less helpful.

Generally speaking, I'm skeptical of PhD programs because they tend to really restrict your options (committing you to a path for several years), which seems bad early on when you're just learning about what you can do.

My intuition is that a PhD is a pretty poor path toward earning a lot of money, because the earnings are not a guarantee and they are in the more distant future, requiring discounting for both time and probability.  An economics PhD might be an exception for opening up superior finance careers, but I suspect that if you have the talent to do well in finance, you'd have that talent immediately and could go in straight away.  That's just a guess though.<!--more-->

Notably, this time distance and the option-closing inflexibility seems especially bad when you consider the fact that (luckily) it seems EA is heading long-term toward having more money than talent.  Thus, it seems best to me (right now, based on what I know), for really dedicated EAs to head toward doing more direct work than earning to give.  So not only do I think PhDs are an inferior path to earning to give, I think earning to give might be an inferior path altogether.

Thus, in my opinion, what you're really comparing PhDs on is the "valuable academic research" route.  This way, getting a PhD could be valuable direct work.  Here, my intuitions lean to economics PhD over neuroscience for a variety of reasons: (1) economics seems more relevant to policy and thus more likely to make changes that lead to impact, (2) economists seem more credible as influencers generally, and (3) economists get to focus specifically on the developing world over the developed world where needs seem less strong.  (Also, weighted in the favor of economics is the non-direct impact stuff.)

I know you've been thinking through this a lot and have been having a hard time choosing between many different choices.  My guess is that if you're not >95% committed to an economics PhD for reasons both including effective altruism and including non-EA stuff like personal satisfaction / enjoyment / etc., you should hold off and do something that keeps your options open.  Learn more about what direct work you could do or what your earnings in finance et. al. could be (perhaps by trying these things for a year each or something), and then make a decision based off that.  You'll be in a much better position to make an informed choice after that.

In addition, you might find it useful to reflect on your open options with criteria on paper, like I did <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-case-study-i-mostly-finished-choosing-between-careers/">here</a>.  Then publish it for people to review and critique.  This was the single most helpful thing I did for myself, but I understand it's not how everyone thinks through things best.]]></content:encoded>

Some exceptions might be: (i) if doing a graduate degree lets you get an impressive university on your CV (ii) if you get strong quant skills out of it, which could be a route to earning lots in finance.

				<title>Effective Altruism is Not a Competition</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the past, some people have suggested that we "gamify" effective altruism some more, and create points for doing altruistic-y things, like donating our money or volunteering our time.  I think this could be a good idea, but rather than seeing individual scores, I'd much rather see a collective team score for EA.  We'd compete as a group to beat our past group selves (make March better than February, for example) rather than compete amongst ourselves as individuals.

There are several problems with the individual competition model, but the biggest problem is the most fundamental -- <b>effective altruism is not</b> (and shouldn't be) <b>a competition.</b>  Rather, we are a team.  A community.  We all have one common goal.

I know some effective altruists who see EAs like Holden Karnofsky or what not do incredible things, and feel a little bit of resentment at themselves and others; feeling inadequate that they can't make such a large difference.  This is an important feeling for generating a desire to improve, and keeping a <a href="http://michaelgr.com/2007/04/15/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset-which-one-are-you/">growth mindset</a> in the face of this could lead to great things for you.  However, it's even more important not to let this get you into depression, <b>simply because Holden's success is also your success.</b>

All effective altruists care about is making sure that the world is a better place.  It doesn't matter who is doing the better-ing.  If Holden, Bill Gates, and Dustin Moskovitz each have 1 billion EA points and you only have five, you should be celebrating the fact that the EA community is collectively at 3 billion and five EA points and that you're helping.  You shouldn't feel bad that you're not doing as well.

We all have different skills and abilities.  Growth mindset does say that we each have an ability to be incredibly effective and altruistic, but we still all start with different places.  It's simply not the case that all of us, right this year, could be making seven figure donations to GiveWell or be putting in 80 hours a week at a top non-profit.  But we all can do our best and try a little harder.

Let's start seeing ourselves more as a community where everyone has something to offer and celebrate our collective success, not despair over who is or is not the most effective.  Effective altruism shouldn't be a competition (at least, among individuals).

An additional reason to avoid competition is that it might lead to perverse incentives, in terms of seeing yourself as opposed to the work of others and therefore not wanting to help others, or in the worst case actively hoping others fail. In certain academic environments, students may hope their classmates fail the test if it's graded on a curve.

I'm also nervous about gamification even in a noncompetitive way for two reasons:
1. I fear the numerical rewards may not accurately track the actual value produced. For instance, if you get 10 points for a blog post, this encourages writing even when you have little to say, or splitting up one post into three.
2. External incentives tend to reduce intrinsic motivation. It's important for EAs to continue to enjoy EA even when the game framework is not in place.

I may be underestimating the upside of gamification, though, because I'm personally not strongly motivated by gamification. I have my own internal estimates of value, and made-up numerical scores don't change that.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I still do these...  Yeah.

<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/14/the-virtue-of-silence/">"The Virtue of Silence"</a>: "Leah Libresco writes a couple of essays on an ethical dilemma reported in the New York Times. In the course of a confidential medical history, a doctor hears her patient is suffering from stress-related complaints after having sent an innocent man to prison. The doctor wants to know whether it is ethical to report the matter to the police. The Times’ columnist says yes – it would save the poor prisoner. Leah says no – violating medical confidentiality creates an expectation that medical confidentiality will be violated in the future, thus dooming patients who are too afraid to talk about drug use or gay sex or other potentially embarrassing but important medical risk factors.  But both sides are ignoring the much bigger dilemma lurking one meta-level up: is it ethical to debate this dilemma in the New York Times?"

<a href="http://utilitarian-essays.com/robustness-against-uncertainty.html">Charity Cost-Effectiveness in an Uncertain World</a>: "Evaluating the effectiveness of our actions, or even just whether they're positive or negative by our values, is very difficult. One approach is to focus on clear, quantifiable metrics and assume that the larger, indirect considerations just kind of work out. Another way to deal with uncertainty is to focus on actions that seem likely to have generally positive effects across many scenarios, and often this approach amounts to meta-level activities like encouraging positive-sum institutions, philosophical inquiry, and effective altruism in general. When we consider flow-through effects of our actions, the seemingly vast gaps in cost-effectiveness among charities are humbled to more modest differences, and we begin to find more worth in the diversity of activities that different people are pursuing. Those who have abnormal values may be more wary of a general "promote wisdom" approach to shaping the future, but it seems plausible that all value systems will ultimately benefit in expectation from a more cooperative and reflective future populace."

<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whynojobs">"The Reason So Many People are Unemployed"</a>: "A good way to wrap your head around this is to think about a much smaller case: instead of the whole economy, let’s think about a now-famous babysitting co-op on Capitol Hill. Instead of dollars, the co-op used its own scrip that was worth an hour of babysitting time. When you wanted to go out, you’d pay a couple hours to someone else to watch your kids; then when they wanted to go out, they’d pay you or someone else to do the same for them.  It all worked great for a while, until one day they found they had too few pieces of scrip. Every couple had only a couple hours left and, having so little, they didn’t want to waste it. So they all decided to save it for a very special occasion. This was kind of an incredible situation — even though there were people who wanted someone to babysit their kids, and people who were willing to do just that, the deal didn’t happen, simply because the co-op hadn’t printed enough colored pieces of paper. Eventually the co-op learned their mistake, printed some more scrip and handed it out, and everybody went back to babysitting like before and were much happier for it."

<a href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2013/02/the-single-most-effective-method-for-influencing-people-fast.php">The Single Most Effective Method for Influencing People Fast</a>: "Influence techniques vary considerably in how effective, ethical and easy to perform they are. At the easy, more ethical end of the spectrum, is affirming someone’s right to choose. This is a benign strategy which happens to have the handy side-effect of increasing persuasion.  But what if you are looking to use a little more effort to get a lot more persuasion-power? Then perhaps the disrupt-then-reframe (DTR) technique is for you.  A word of warning, though: the DTR technique is more of a cheap (but very effective) trick which some might find morally questionable. OK, with the health warning over, here’s what they did in the original study which kicked off this whole line of research."

<a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/02/cognitive-democracy-condorcet-with-competence.html">Cognitive Democracy: Condorcet with Competence</a>: "We usually think of democracy as a way of aggregating diverse preferences but we can also imagine that we share similar preferences and that what we disagree about is the best way to achieve those preferences. From this perspective, democracy can be thought of as a tool for information aggregation. Using simple probability theory, Condorcet showed in 1785 that even when each individual voter has only a slightly better than chance probability of choosing the bettier of two options the probability that majority rule chooses the better outcome quickly goes to 1 as the number of voters increases (the wisdom of the crowds)."

<a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/iro/systematic_lucky_breaks/">Systematic Lucky Breaks:</a> "Many people can point to significant events that improved their lives in a positive way. They often refer to these as 'lucky breaks', and take it for granted that such events are rare. But most of the time 'lucky breaks' don't need to be uncommon-you can often reverse engineer the reasons behind them and cause them to happen more frequently. So when a one-off event ends up contributing a lot of value, you should systematically make it part of your life."</a>

<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/do-unpaid-internships-lead-to-jobs-not-for-college-students/276959/">"Do Unpaid Internships Lead to Jobs? Not for College Students"</a>: "The common defense of the unpaid internship is that, even if the role doesn't exactly pay, it will pay off eventually in the form of a job. Turns out, the data suggests that defense is wrong, at least when it comes to college students."

Amid all the focus on how much it costs precisely to save a life, here's a good reminder from GiveWell that <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/11/the-moral-case-for-giving-doesnt-rely-on-questionable-quantitative-estimates/">the moral case for giving doesn't rely on questionable quantitative estimates"</a>: "To us, the strongest form of the challenge is not 'How much should I give when $X saves a life?' but 'How much should I give, knowing that I have massive wealth compared to the global poor?'"

I'm no expert (I've only taken one economics class and done a little independent research) but I think this article is largely inaccurate. Swartz is describing monetary policy—the process of controlling the money supply. Keynes' main point was about fiscal policy—changing government taxation and expenditures to improve the economy. Keynes' idea was that the government should spend more money to increase aggregate demand. I couldn't find a source on this, but I think pretty much all economists agree that rampant inflation is really bad, and the Fed is right to be concerned about it.

For people who aren't too familiar with economics (like me), I suggest reading the IGM Economic Experts Panel to see what economists tend to agree on: http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel

Stay tuned and sorry for all the problems.]]></content:encoded>
