You can contact me a variety of ways, and I love correspondence with those who use this site.  The most efficient and reliable method would be to send an email to <a href="mailto:peter@peterhurford.com">peter@peterhurford.com</a>.

However, you can also reach out to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterhurford">my Twitter</a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterhurford">@peterhurford</a>) or my <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/peterhurford/">Reddit account</a>.  If you know me more personally, you could also reach out to me via Facebook, Skype, text message, phone call, or in person.
