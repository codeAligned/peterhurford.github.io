<b>Direct Continuation of: <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/what-is-peter-reading">What is Peter Reading?</a></b>

Since July 1, 2011, I've been cataloging and rating all the books I have read.  Now that this list is getting a bit long, I'd like to embark on a slightly more ambitious project -- not only rating them, but also reviewing them, and writing summaries of the books I like (or linking to other summaries/reviews).
