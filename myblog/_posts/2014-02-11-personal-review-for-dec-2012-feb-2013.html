<i>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/a-year-of-mostly-new-years-resolutions/">"A Year of Mostly New Years Resolutions"</a> and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/six-month-review-ii-june-november-2013/">"Six Month Review II: June-November 2013"</a>.</i>

Every month for all of 2013, I reviewed how my life was going.  I also punctuated this with two six-month reviews, where I focused on longer-term goals.  This year, I find both of those review cycles not working very well for me.  While I still find reviewing each day, week, and month useful, I don't find it useful to write about them.  Instead, I want to write in order to reflect upon my goals.  However, I don't want to wait <i>six months</i> to do a six-month review.  I think I have useful things to say now based on what I have collected.  So one month is too fast.  Six months is too slow.  So now we're at a compromise where my only public self-reviews (and only lengthy ones -- the others all don't involve writing anymore) will be three month reviews.

So now I'll do a little write up for each of my goals, do some analysis, and then come away with new goals for the next three months.

<h2>Goal #1: Thinking Through Complex Issues</h2>
I have certain questions that I find important.  I want to blog through them, here.

<b>"What should I do when I graduate?"</b> ...

<b>"What normative framework should I choose?"</b> ...

<b>"What would someone acting out utilitarianism in their everyday life look like?"</b> ...

<b>"How, if at all, can utilitarianism be presented as a robust moral theory?"</b> ...

<b>"What causes should a utilitarian focus on?"</b> ...

<b>"How, if at all, should I change my lifestyle?"</b> ...
