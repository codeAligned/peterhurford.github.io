It's something of folk wisdom that "money can't buy happiness".  However, like most folk wisdom, it has been shattered through scientific analysis.  Or has it?  The problem is that there has been a lot of attention to the connection between how much money one has and how happy they are, and different investigation comes to slightly different conclusions.

But why might this be the case?  I decided I was confused enough about the relationship between money and happiness that I wanted to look at all these studies and try and get to the bottom of things.<!--more-->

<h2>What Correlates with Happiness?</h2>
One thing that is clear is if money has some correlation with happiness, it's one correlate among many.  Interestingly and perhaps frustratingly, ones genes account for 38%[A] to to 80%[B] of the variation between happiness among people, with most studies settling on 50%[C].  This indicates that there is a "baseline" happiness that people tend to revert to over time[D]

Factors that correlate moderately with happiness include: health,13 social activity,14 and religiosity.15 Factors that correlate strongly with happiness include: genetics,16 love and relationship satisfaction,17 and work satisfaction.18

13 Those with disabling health conditions are happier than you might think (Myers 1992; Riis et al. 2005; Argyle 1999).

14 Those who are satisfied with their social life are moderately more happy than others (Diener & Seligman 2004; Myers 1999; Diener & Seligman 2002).

15 Religiosity correlates with happiness (Abdel-Kahlek 2005; Myers 2008), though it may be religious attendance and not religious belief that matters (Chida et al. 2009).

16 Past happiness is the best predictor of future happiness (Lucas & Diener 2008). Happiness is surprisingly unmoved by external factors (Lykken & Tellegen 1996), because genes accounts for about 50% of the variance in happiness (Lyubomirsky et al. 2005; Stubbe et al. 2005).

17 Married people are happier than those who are single or divorced (Myers & Diener 1995; Diener et al. 2000), and marital satisfaction predicts happiness (Proulx et al. 2007).

18 Unemployment makes people very unhappy (Argyle 2001), and job satisfaction is strongly correlated with happiness (Judge & Klinger 2008; Warr 1999).
