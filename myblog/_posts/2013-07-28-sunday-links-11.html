<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/21/a-defense-of-logical-positivism-yes-really/">"A Defense of Logical Positivism (Yes, Really)"</a>.  I've always kind of thought like this.  Goes along with <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/k2/a_priori/">this take on a priori reasoning</a>.

<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/awm/how_to_avoid_dying_in_a_car_crash/">"How to Avoid Dying in a Car Crash"</a>.  This is important, because it's one of the highest causes of death for developed-world people aged 15-24, like me.  The tips?

As Dan Gilbert points out <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html">in his TED Talk</a>, our beliefs about what will make us happy are often wrong.  It turns out we can adapt and find happiness in even some of the worst situations.  Hilarity ensues.

Value of information is important.  <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/85x/value_of_information_four_examples/">Here are four examples</a>.

<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/08/the_importance_1.html">"The Importance of Security Engineering"</a>.  Also, should we pursue <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/03/security_awaren_1.html">security awareness training</a>?
