People say there are only 24 hours in a day, and you can't make the day any longer.  This is true -- to a point.  Really, however, when you're sleeping eight hours a night, there are only 16 hours in a day, and you can make the day longer by <i>sleeping less</i>. To be blunt: sleeping feels like a waste of time.  It's fun to fall asleep and it's fun to be in bed, but I really wish it didn't have to take so long.

Unfortunately, you can't just sleep less and expect to be fine.  Sleeping is mostly a mystery, but not sleeping enough makes me feel really crappy, and seems unhealthy.  Therefore, I've decided to sleep only six hours a night and take <a href="">I've been keeping a daily log</a> of my sleep, doing my best to track how different sleep schedules affect my feelings of grogginess throughout the day, productivity, mood, attitude, alertness, creativity, and athletic ability.<!--more-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Theory</h2>
Quite a few people have anecdotally confirmed that one can start with the traditional eight hours of being awake and peel off an hour and a half in exchange for a twenty minute nap (i.e. sleeping 6 hours at night with a 20 minute nap at midday, rather than sleeping 8 hours at night).  For example, see <a href="http://dustincurtis.com/sleep.html">Dustin Curtis</a>, <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/>The Polyphasic Society</a>, <a href="www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2011/03/biphasic-sleep/">Steve Pavlina</a>, <a href="http://www.ndoherty.com/siesta/">Niall Doherty</a>, and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5302591/implement-advanced-siestas-for-improved-sleep">Lifehacker</a>.  This is, presumably and speculatively, because naps are more efficient for REM sleep.

This principle of exchanging 1hr40min of "core sleep" at night for naps seems to work indefinitely, even to the point of a sleep schedule that consists of only six 20-minute naps, called the "Uberman" sleep schedule.  Such a schedule is difficult to adapt to and fit in to a normal social life, so I'm going to not go quite that crazy.

Instead, I'm going to stick with the "siesta" method for awhile.  I don't want to mess with my sleep too much if I don't understand it, but increased time is very helpful, and I would be willing to sacrifice a little to experiment with gaining it.  Right now, I'm aiming to be asleep 1-7am and nap 4-4:30pm, but I've been experimenting with moving this around, cutting it further, and sleeping longer.

<b>The idea isn't to sleep deprive yourself.</b>  At least, not in the long-run.  If everything is going to plan, you should be able to sleep for less time AND get a higher quality sleep, continuing to wake up more refreshed than you did before, and remaining more alert than you did before.  That being said, <a href="">this probably doesn't work for everyone</a>.  And some people need more sleep than others.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Learning to Nap</h2>
For me, the ideal amount of time to nap is twenty minutes.  And by this, I actually mean twenty minutes, <i>including time spent going to sleep</i> -- I get to my bed, set the alarm for twenty minutes in the future, put my head down, go to sleep, actually sleep, and wake up all within twenty minutes.  I tried 90 minutes and I've tried 30 minutes, and both times I woke up groggy.  If you're doing the nap right, you should wake up feeling great and ready to go.

I can drift off to sleep in about five minutes or less, I think.  One thing that really helped me was developing habits of counting and clearing my mind.  I put my head on the pillow and start to breath slowly.  I then count my breaths, counting "1" as I breathe in, "2" as I breathe out, "3" as I breathe in again, etc.  I try my hardest to focus on this counting and not think of anything else.  I also try hard to think in pictures and create dreams.  Often, I'll try to imagine pictures of some of my favorite places, or literally "count sheep" by imagining a sheep hopping over a fence for each number that I count.

I'd have no clue if this would work for anyone else.  I've heard that naps take practice like anything else.  My naps kind of sucked for the first two weeks, but now I can take a twenty minute nap and feel like I just slept for a few hours.  If you're having trouble napping after two weeks of practice, you're probably making classic mistakes like having your nap at the wrong time (and not being tired enough), drinking caffeine, or exercising / eating too close to your nap.

<h2>One Month Analysis</h2>
Overall, my attempt to make this sleep schedule was not as stable as I would have liked.  I initially tried to do five hours of sleep at night with a ninety minute nap in the day, which is another method of siesta sleep that also is said to work well.  I started on 4 June, and kept it up for two days before messing up.  On 11 June I tried again and kept it up for five days.  I was then able to keep it up from 19 to 21 June.

But how did I do?

<b>Total time spent asleep:</b> From 3 Jun to 3 July, I spent 221 hours asleep, for an average of 7.5 hours a day.  This is about the average I'd get during a disciplined school year, but I'd usually feel pretty crappy about it.  Normally during the summer when I can sleep as long as I want, I sleep 8.5 hours a night.  Therefore, I've gained about 30 extra hours of wakefulness this month, basically creating more than a whole day out of nothing.

<b>Grogginess:</b> On my normal (monophasic) method of sleep, I'd have to sleep more than 7.5 hours a night, or I'd feel really groggy, and I'd usually get 51-59 hours of sleep a week.  Currently, I'm feeling like I do when I get 59 hours of sleep a week, but with only 52 hours of sleep a week.  If this holds, I have the potential to get 45-49 hours of sleep a week and still feel just as rested throughout the day.  One potential problem, however, is grogginess on waking.  This still occurs a lot, leading me to mess things up by going back to sleep.  I need to be more disciplined about this and work to fix my sleeping times so I wake up less groggy.  Oversleeping also remains a risk, though it was only harmful one time.

<b>Productivity/Alertness:</b> I owe this also to <a href="">my New Years Resolutions commitment device</a>, but productivity has shot through the roof.  Before, on a summer day, I'd be "wasting" about ten hours a day on sleep, games, and aimless reading.  Now, I'm "wasting" about eight hours, tops.  I've gained a solid 2-3 hours of extra work per day, without feeling exhausted.  I also feel pretty alert and focused throughout the day, especially after the nap.

<b>Mood/Attitude:</b> It's hard to remember what my mood was like beforehand, but this feels about the same.  I've tried to track in my log where I've felt especially irritable, and so far it's only happened once.

<b>Creativity:</b> Likewise, it's hard to remember how creative I was beforehand, but I feel about as creative, if not maybe a little more creative.

<b>Athletic Ability:</b> Athletic ability has remained stable, I think.  I initially lost some ability in running and strength, but that was due to not keeping up to consistent exercise, I think, rather than sleeping.  (And the lack of consistency was due to travel, not to sleep.)  I was able to regain all my strength and still make a personal running distance record while sleeping less.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
I have a lot left to learn and need a lot more practice, but this seems promising.
