<b>Follow up to <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/">How Much Does it Cost to Buy a Vegetarian?</a></b>

Naïve cost-effectiveness estimates suggest that if we assume (a) a pamphlet costs 20 cents, (b) 2% of people who receive a pamphlet go vegetarian for (c) an average of four years each, and (d) the average meat eater would eat 40 animals a year, then <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/">it costs a mere seven cents</a> to avert a year of nonhuman animal suffering on a factory farm.  That's a pretty good deal.

The problem is, however, that more work needs to be done on making these assumptions accurate -- particularly (b) and (c).  While <a href="http://humaneleaguelabs.wordpress.com/upcoming-research/">more studies are on their way</a>, it's interesting to think just how low (b) and (c) can be while still being better than our current best option.<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I take the current best option to be <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com">The Against Malaria Foundation</a>.  Perhaps there are other contenders for the best option, whether they be <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">speculative causes</a> or <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-would-it-take-to-prove-a-speculative-cause/">causes soon getting robust measurement</a>, but none of them have been presented with a clear enough estimate yet to make this calculation work.  Whether or not you think this is a flaw in the speculative causes or a flaw in my reasoning about causes is <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/">a discussion for elsewhere</a>.

<a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved">According to GiveWell</a>, AMF saves a life for $2500, though this number has recently been <a href="https://twitter.com/GiveWell/status/341706469256871937">revised down to $2000</a> because of the <a href="http://news.againstmalaria.com/post/2013/06/03/LLINs-are-now-close-to-US3-per-net.aspx">newly reduced cost of bed nets</a>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
But, of course, "save a life" doesn't make sense because everyone dies eventually.  As the joke goes, <a href="http://www.sens.org/">life extension research</a> is the only charity actually working on <i>saving</i> lives.  But <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2007/12/04/what-a-life-saved-means/">GiveWell clarifies</a>:

<blockquote><span>If you save someone right as they exit infancy (5 years old), you’ve saved someone who probably has around a 50% chance of making it to age 60 … another way of putting this is that if you save two lives (very very rough estimate of cost: $2000), you’ve in expectation given one person a full life that they wouldn’t have had. (You’re actually getting more than this, of course, since a person has a 75% chance of making it to age 30, but let’s keep it simple.)</span></blockquote>

So, on this model, $2000 "buys" an additional thirty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year">years of healthy life</a> that would not have otherwise existed.  Simplifying, that's $66 to save a year of healthy life.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now let's go back to the assumptions.

For the same $66 you spend to save a year of healthy life via bednets, you could avert 942 years of nonhuman animal suffering on a factory farm given the assumptions we listed above.

This seems to give us a lot of room for pessimism.  What if we assumed the response rate were not 2%, but instead one tenth that -- 0.2%?  We'd still be averting a year of factory farming for 69 cents.  What conversion rate would it take to get to AMF's $66 mark?  <b>0.002%</b>, or <b>one person who becomes a vegetarian for every fifty thousand people who receive a pamphlet.</b>

Of course, even if you're on board with nonhuman animal suffering as something that matters, you might not think it's appropriate to weigh a year of chicken suffering averted as equal to a year of healthy human life gained.  It's a tricky philosophical question after all.  But even if you thought it took 100 chickens to outweigh a human, veg ads would still be worth it even if they only convinced <b>one in every five hundred people</b>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Indeed, we can be pessimistic on all counts.

...We could think it takes 10 chickens to outweigh a human.
...We could think the current studies are bad enough that they're off by a factor of 10.
...And we could think that people who convert only convert for one year on average rather than four years.

...And veg ads would still have <b>three fold</b> the cost-effectiveness of AMF.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now don't get me wrong, I actually think it's possible that the current studies are off by a factor of 10 or more.  This is why I think it's better to study veg ads than to fund them directly.

But I don't want this to be a cause for large despair, because <b>veg advocacy doesn't have to be all that good to be worth it.</b>
