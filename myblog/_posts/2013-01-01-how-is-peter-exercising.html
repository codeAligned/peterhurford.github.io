I've made a variety of New Years Resolutions this year to commit to exercise.  I decided that I want a more detailed log to keep track of my progress on these plans so I know where to resume for future exercises and look back on my progress.  I then decided, in the spirit of my <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-reading">reading list</a> and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-watching">TV list</a>, why not make this public too?

Currently, I'm working on (1) <a href="http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/">Stronglifts 5x5 Beginner Strength Training Program</a> and (2) running once a week.

In the past, I've committed to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0938045768">Convict Conditioning</a> with the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1gbfx2/training_for_34_hours_a_day_6_days_a_week_as_ido/">Reddit modifications</a>, the Mount Holyoke’s Athletic Training <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_D_IjuAUl8">"No Excuses Workout"</a> [YouTube], a vaguer kind of <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/?smid=fb-nytimes&WT.z_sma=HL_TS7_20130510">high intensity interval circuit training</a>, the <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml">Couch to 5K</a> running plan, the <a href="http://www.hundredpushups.com">Hundred Pushups plan</a>, and the <a href="http://www.twohundredsitups.com">Two Hundred Sit-ups plan</a>, but for various reasons, I'm not doing those anymore.

Nothing in this list is meant to be that awe inspiring.  I recognize myself as below average at fitness, but I'm getting much better.<!--more-->
