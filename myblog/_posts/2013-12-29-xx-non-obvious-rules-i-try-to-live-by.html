Personal rules are important for life.  Some people talk about the difference between <a href="">shoulds and musts</a>, and highlight musts as more effective for creating personal change.  While I'm not perfect, trying to adhere to all these rules has made me much happier, much healthier, less stressed, and more productive.

I've left off the obvious rules like don't murder.  I'm not saying these rules are right or even saying that you ought to follow them, but I offer these rules to learn more about me and perhaps maybe inspire yourself to have some rules.  Perhaps you already have some rules of your own.  If you do, I encourage you to write them down (Rule #X).

<ol>
<li>I will be the person I want to be.</li>
<li>I will always seek to follow the rules that allow me to maximize happiness and minimize suffering.  I will be thankful that I have identified what I want to do so early in life.</li>
<li>I will <a href="">live frugally</a> and work to <a href="">donate as much excess money as I can</a> to <a href="">the most effective charities I can find</a>, knowing <a href="">this money will mean so much more to others than it will to me</a> and that there's <a href="">large differences in the value each dollar will have depending on where it goes</a>.  I will remember that this frugality is not a sacrifice, but rather <a href="">a path to a meaningful life</a>.
<li>I will work no less than an average of ten hours a day, because I have important things to do and I have found work I enjoy.  I will <a href="">use a significant portion of this work-time to benefit the less fortunate</a>.</li>
<li>I will work no more than an average of twelve hours a day, because overwork can lead to dangerous burnout.  Social time is also very important, both for its own sake and for the sake of improving work time.</li>
<li>I will never eat meat and I will avoid eating eggs.</li>
<li>I will follow a healthy diet that gets me all the nutrition I need, as much as possible.</li>
<li>I will only eat unhealthy snacks on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and holidays.</li>
<li>I will exercise <a href="">with weights</a> when possible (and <a href="">bodyweights</a> when not possible) every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.  I will run every Saturday.</li>
<li>I will not lie.</li>
<li>I will avoid multitasking.</li>
<li>I will write things down when I can.</li>
<li>I will go to bed early.  I aim to get in bed by 9:30p or 10p as much as I can, though I stay up late for social reasons once a week.</li>
<li>I will <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/segmented-sleep/">segment my sleep</a>.  This is weird, so I don't usually talk about it.  But it feels a lot more restful, is allegedly healthier, and lets me get away with sleeping a little bit less.  I also try to add a midday nap, either <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/dual-core/">to a segmented sleep schedule</a> or a <a href="http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/siesta/">regular sleep schedule</a>.</li>
<li>I will consume caffeine rarely; only when I'm trying to stay up very late for important social reasons.  I make sure to avoid drinking caffeine within eight hours of my bed time.</li>
<li>I will create a to-do list at the end of each day and follow it at the start of the next day.  I <a href="">follow all my own advice on productivity</a>.</li>
</ol>
