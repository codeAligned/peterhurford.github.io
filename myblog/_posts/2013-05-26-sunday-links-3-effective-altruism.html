Welcome to the third edition of Sunday Links!  This time, I want to explore links on one particular concept: <i>effective altruism</i>, a concept near and dear to both my heart and utilitarianism.

Peter Singer summarizes effective altruism <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Diuv3XZQXyc">in his recent TED Talk</a>.

What's the key idea?  Will Crouch <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/node/4">defines effective altruism</a> as starting with a "how" (a desire to do as much good as possible) and moving to a "what" (whatever does the most good), instead of the typical model of altruism, which starts with a "what" (ending cancer) and moving to a "how" (whatever campaigns end cancer).  It's very closely related to the idea of <a href="http://www.tacticalphilanthropy.com/2010/10/the-rise-of-issue-agnostic-philanthropy/">issue-agnostic philanthropy</a>.

Perhaps the biggest take away is that philanthropy involves trade-offs, because donating in one place means we're not donating in another place.  However, because our money could have gone further elsewhere, <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">we end up hurting people unintentionally</a>.  My favorite case for understanding the need for effective altruism involves Scott Siskind's <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/">summary of efficient charity</a>, which I referenced before.  To make the idea of opportunity costs in spending apparent, Scott Siskind also jokingly suggests <a href="http://www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html">we adopt dead child currency</a>.

One example of effective altruism is to <a href="http://www.givewell.org/want-to-change-peoples-lives-give-internationally">focus more on the developing world than on the developed world</a>.  This might seem unintuitive at first, but when I think about it <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/49-on-triage">in terms of triage</a> or Julia Wise's <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2012/02/our-worst-subjects.html">notion of worst subjects</a>, it makes sense to me.  Jeff Kaufman's <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2011-10-15">debate with a pro-local friend of his</a> also helps.

But wouldn't this be really hard?  Well, the secret is that <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/why-give/how-rich-am-i">we're rich</a>, compared to the developing world.  But even so, <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/03/it-doesnt-have-to-be-hard.html">it doesn't have to be hard</a>.  You could just start <i>somewhere</i>, for some amount.

Where should you start?  I recommend a few places, like <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com">The Life You Can Save</a>, <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>. <a href="http://80000hours.org">80000 Hours</a>, and <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/">Effective Animal Activism</a>.

There's much more that needs to be said, but this should be enough to get you going.  A whole world of helping more by "working smarter, not harder" awaits.
