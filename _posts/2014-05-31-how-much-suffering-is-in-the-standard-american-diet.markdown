We all know that "the standard American diet" is unhealthy, and bad for the environment, and all sorts of things.  But, as we know, it also contains a lot of suffering due to the consumption of factory-farmed meat.  I'm not going to argue for the ethics of a vegetarian diet here ([I've done that elsewhere]()).  Instead, I'm interested in some quantification -- just *how much* suffering is in the standard American diet?

As a caveat, at the moment I'm not looking at environmental impact, though I might expand the analysis later.  As another caveat, it's worth pointing out that the standard American diet may not really exist in any particular person, but it's a useful statistical generalization to talk about.

To begin, we need to know three things: (a) how many animal products are in the standard american diet, (b) how many animals does it take to produce that much meat, and (c) how much suffering is brought about by each kind of animal?

Let's go! <!-- more -->


## American Meat Consumption

Luckily for us, the USDA is pretty obsessive with cataloging our food consumption.  The USDA's [Profiling Food Consumption in America](http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter2.pdf) p15 says that in 2000, Americans consume, on average, per year:

* 64.4 pounds of beef
* 47.7 pounds of pork
* 52.9 pounds of poultry
* 13.6 pounds of turkey
* 15.2 pounds of fish and shellfish
* 250 eggs
* 29.8 pounds of cheese
* 27.8 pounds of frozen dairy products (e.g., ice cream)
* 22.6 pounds of milk



## Animals Needed to Produce Each Kind of Meat

In Brian Tomasik's ["How Much Direct Suffering Is Caused by Various Animal Foods?"](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html]), Brian has a very similar goal to ours here, so we only need to extend his analysis to match up with the entire American diet, rather than individual animals.

Brian says that:

* ...one beef cow produces 339kg of beef (747 pounds)
* ...one pig produces 91.1kg of pork (201 pounds)
* ...one meat chicken produces 1.83kg of poultry (4 pounds)
* ...one turkey produces 10.3kg of turkey meat (22.7 pounds)
* ...one egg chicken produces 15.3kg of eggs
* ...one dairy cow produces 50,420kg of milk (111,157 pounds)

These numbers are good for our analysis, but a bit more work needs to be done to make the numbers work for us.


#### Eggs

First of all, how many eggs is 15.3kg of eggs?  [Wikipedia gives a list of egg sizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_egg_sizes), and says that the typical egg is "large" sized, or 57g.  57g is 0.13 pounds, which means that 15.3kg of eggs (34 pounds) is 262 eggs.


#### Dairy

Second, we know that dairy cows produce 50,420kg of milk, but what is that in terms of cheese and frozen dairy products?  If we could convert cheese and frozen dairy products into milk equivalents, we could make a cleaner calculation.  [The Moomilk FAQ](http://www.moomilk.com/faq/2-milk-faqs/35-how-many-pounds-of-milk-does-it-take-to-make-1-gallon-of-ice-cream-how-many-pounds-of-milk-does-it-take-to-make-1-pound-of-cheese) pegs 1 gallon of ice cream at 12 pounds of milk and 1 pound of cheese at 10 pounds of milk.

But how much does a gallon of ice cream weigh?  Now we've descended to Wiki Answers (sorry!), but we come out with something: [4.5 pounds](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_much_does_one_gallon_of_ice_cream_weigh?#slide=2).

So we can take the 29.8 pounds of cheese and convert it to 298 pounds of milk equivalent.   Similarly, we can take the 27.8 pounds of frozen dairy products and convert it to 74 pounds of milk equivalent.  In total, that's 394.6 pounds of milk per year for the average American.


#### Fish

Last, and the most troublesome, is working out fish.  14.2 pounds of fish and shellfish is not very helpful, because these animals are vastly different in sizes (and presumably suffering capacities).  For this analysis, I'm really only interested in factory farmed aquaculture fish, so I'll switch over to [Counting Animal's estimate](http://www.countinganimals.com/how-many-animals-does-a-vegetarian-save/) of 1.3 aquacultured fish.

Note that the aquaculturing of fish means that up to 225 wild fish are being caught to feed the aquacultured fish, but I'm uncomfortable including this number because I'm not sure that reducing the demand for fish will result in any significant reduction in suffering for wild fish.  While certainly fishing is painful for wild fish and there are great environmental concerns with overfishing, I'm choosing to not include them in this analysis.



## American Animal Consumption

Now that we have these statistics, we can find out not how many pounds of animal meat is consumed each year by a typical American, but rather *how many animals are consumed*.

*drumroll please...*

* 0.09 cows for beef
* 0.004 cows for dairy
* 0.24 pigs
* 13.2 chickens for meat
* 0.95 chickens for egg
* 0.6 turkeys
* 1.3 aquacultured fish



## But How Much Suffering is That?

Obviously quantifying suffering is very tricky, so I'm going to be careful about it here.  Stay with me.  Let's first look to how many days of suffering each animal undergoes, sort of like a [DALY metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year) would do for quantifying suffering in humans.

Looking to Brian's table, [we get the following information](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html#section4):

* Cows for beef live 402 days on average
* Cows for dairy = 2009 days
* Pigs = 183 days
* Chickens for meat = 42 days
* Chickens for eggs = 365 days
* Turkeys = 126 days
* Aquacultured fish = 730 days

So the average American is producing, each year on average...

* 36 days of suffering via beef
* 8 days of suffering via dairy
* 44 days of suffering via pork
* 554 days of suffering via chicken meat
* 347 days of suffering via eggs
* 76 days of suffering via turkey
* 949 days of suffering via aquacultured fish

...Or a total of 5 years, 6 months, 5 days of animal suffering each year.  Yikes!


#### Adjusting for Context

But we can get a bit more precise at the cost of being a bit more speculative, if you don't mind me experimenting, because I don't think that each animal suffers the same.  Instead, each animal has (a) different intensity of farming conditions and (b) a different capacity for suffering.  Brian's table takes this into account, and suggests the following adjustment ratios:

* Beef - 1
* Dairy - 1.8
* Pork - 1.8
* Chicken (meat) - 1.8
* Chicken (eggs) - 2.5
* Turkey - 1.8
* Aquacultured Fish - 0.9

I'd like more research into this, but right now I'm willing for Brian's work to be taken at face value.

Taking these ratios into account, we adjust to the new totals:

* 36 adjusted days of suffering via beef
* 14 adjusted days of suffering via dairy
* 79 adjusted days of suffering via pork
* 997 adjusted days of suffering via chicken meat
* 867 adjusted days of suffering via eggs
* 136 adjusted days of suffering via turkey
* 854 adjusted days of suffering via aquacultured fish

(The adjustment is technically in units of "days of beef suffering equivalents".)


#### Relative Importance

I think these adjustments are important not for coming to a more accurate total of years of suffering caused per year of American diet, but rather for more accurately determining which food groups are the most important to target.  For example, based on these adjusted numbers, we can tentatively (and perhaps naively) conclude:

* Giving up beef is ~2.5x as important as giving up dairy.
* Giving up pork is ~2.1x as important as giving up beef.
* Giving up chicken meat is ~27.7x as important as giving up beef.
* Giving up eggs is ~24x as important as giving up beef.
* Giving up turkey is ~3.7x as important as giving up beef.
* Giving up aquacultured fish is ~23.7x as important as giving up beef.

So this gives a pretty good approach for a "meat reduction" diet, with the most ethical bang-for-the-buck for each animal product given up.  Maybe consider eating all the beef, turkey, and dairy you want, but spare the really important ones -- chicken, eggs, and fish!
