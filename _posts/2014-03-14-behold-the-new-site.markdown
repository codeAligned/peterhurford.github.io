I think it's important to keep things fresh.  It seems like at least once a year or so, I change what the site looks like.  This year, server problems, financial costs, and other bloat inspired me to move away from Wordpress and paid hosting on Dreamhost to the wonderful land of a Jekyll static blog hosted by GitHub pages.  Back five years ago when I first signed on with Dreamhost, none of these tools existed.  Now, it's time that I finally adopt them.

I'll still have to get used to writing in Markdown.  But hopefully you find this site faster and easier to use than before.  It sure looks better on mobile phones.  Let me know if you have any comments.
