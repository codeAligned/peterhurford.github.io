I went into a CVS and found strange locks on all of the Tide detergent containers that needed to be unlocked at the register during purchase.  I was really confused, until I read that [Tide is _drug currency_](http://nymag.com/news/features/tide-detergent-drugs-2013-1/).

[Yet another essay on why social science needs to publish replications](http://andrewgelman.com/2013/05/31/how-to-fix-the-tabloids-toward-replicable-social-science-research/).

[Perhaps we should go to Mercury for a colony rather than Mars?](http://einstein-schrodinger.com/mercury_colony.html)  Mercury has very reasonable underground temperatures and much better prospects for solar power than Mars.

[Alonzo Fyfe says what I've been thinking](http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-right-to-remain-silent.html) about whether it makes sense to have a "right to remain silent".  Presumably, if the person is guilty, and they have some sort of evidence of their own guilt, than shouldn't they ought to be compelled to provide that evidence, given that it helps put punish a guilty person?  The problems, then, are really in the nature of the coercion and whether this coercion would negatively effect innocent people enough as to be worth it.  But that seems better stopped by outlawing "cruel and unusual tactics" and regulating interrogation better.  To be clear, I'm not saying I don't like the "right to remain silent", just that I can't currently make sense of it.

As far as elections go, [the Papal election would be pretty hard to hack](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/02/hacking_the_pap.html).  ...Though I don't think all the pomp, circumstance, and colored smoke would go over well in the Presidential election.

[How panhandlers use free credit cards](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/02/hacking_the_pap.html).

[A quick overview of meta-ethics](http://lesswrong.com/lw/5eh/what_is_metaethics/) as good as any lengthy textbook.

[Does studying economics make people selfish?](http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.kr/2012/11/re-post-does-studying-economics-make.html).  Seeing an article with that question as the headline leads me to invoke [Betteridge's law of headlines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines) and know in advance the answer is "no", but it was still a good read to find out _why_.

A good analysis of asking ["how else do you explain it?"](http://www.butterfliesandwheels.org/2004/how-else-do-you-explain-it/).

Julia Wise [explains what it's like to give away 50% of her pre-tax income](http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/whats-it-like-to-give-half.html).

My friend Robert Moore [analyzes the relationship between the estate tax and a meritocracy](http://essentiallyinterdependent.blogspot.com/2013/06/what-role-does-estate-tax-have-in.html).
