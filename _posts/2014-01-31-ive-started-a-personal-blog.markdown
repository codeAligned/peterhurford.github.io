So I haven't been writing as much as I used to, but one thing I have started getting interested in is writing about "not utilitarianism".  Thus, I've thought it easiest to start a new blog elsewhere: **[peterhurford.tumblr.com](http://peterhurford.tumblr.com)**

I’m on Tumblr as a matter of economy — it seemed like a quick and easy way to make a blog happen without mucking around in Wordpress or Jeckyll or what not.  It will be for all my musings that aren't philosophical-y or utilitarian-y enough to go on his *real* blog. But I promise this all maximizes utility somehow...

**Rest assured, I'll still be keeping this blog going.**  But sometimes, I'll have things that are best said elsewhere.  And now I have an elsewhere to say those things.
