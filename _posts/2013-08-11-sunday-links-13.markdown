Many people know of the [tragedy of the commons](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) where individuals don't each have a rational interest in keeping up a public space, and so all suffer.  The problem is insufficient ownership and can be solved by giving each person responsibility for maintaining a specific part.  But have you heard of the opposite problem -- [the tragedy of the anticommons?](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2v/the_tragedy_of_the_anticommons/)  These are problems of _too much_ ownership rather than too little.

[Rational home buying](http://lesswrong.com/lw/7am/rational_home_buying/).  Lots of things go wrong, rationally speaking, when buying a house, so focus up.  Location matters lots, so does thinking clearly about money and savings, thinking realistically and practically about what you'd actually use the house for, happiness from relative not absolute wealth, and not overthinking things.

[Myers-Briggs is a bad indicator of personality.](http://80000hours.org/blog/60-the-myers-briggs-type-indicator-a-popular-but-flawed-way-of-understanding-your-personality)  Use [The Big Five](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) instead.

[Here's a report of the interaction between Peter Singer and Harriet Johnson](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/16/magazine/unspeakable-conversations.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm), a prominent member of the disability rights movement. This is great reading for a more nuanced understanding about how utilitarianism is viewed.

["22 Maps That Show How Americans Speak English Totally Differently From Each Other"](http://www.businessinsider.com/22-maps-that-show-the-deepest-linguistic-conflicts-in-america-2013-6).  _Totally different_ is a stretch, but the maps are still interesting.

So, yeah, the people who have policy opinions that disagree with you [probably aren't moral monsters](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/30/fetal-attraction-abortion-and-the-principle-of-charity/).

["Maximizing Your Donations via a Job"](http://80000hours.org/blog/230-maximizing-your-donations-via-a-job).  Basically a how-to guide to getting a higher salary job in computer programming careers.

["The Roots of Morality: Does Religion Play a Role or is the Tail Wagging the Dog?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7EUIGpKhmY) The title of this YouTube video is technically a false dichotomy, but the video is still interesting.  Presents a lot of modern moral psychology in a compelling way.

[Philosophical landmines](http://lesswrong.com/lw/gm9/philosophical_landmines/) are concepts in philosophy which tend to unnecessarily complicate and derail an otherwise useful conversation.
