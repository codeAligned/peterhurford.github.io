**Follow up to [How Much Does it Cost to Buy a Vegetarian?](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/)**

Naïve cost-effectiveness estimates suggest that if we assume (a) a pamphlet costs 20 cents, (b) 2% of people who receive a pamphlet go vegetarian for (c) an average of four years each, and (d) the average meat eater would eat 40 animals a year, then [it costs a mere seven cents](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/) to avert a year of nonhuman animal suffering on a factory farm.  That's a pretty good deal.

The problem is, however, that more work needs to be done on making these assumptions accurate -- particularly (b) and (c).  While [more studies are on their way](http://humaneleaguelabs.wordpress.com/upcoming-research/), it's interesting to think just how low (b) and (c) can be while still being better than our current best option.<!-- more -->



I take the current best option to be [The Against Malaria Foundation](http://www.againstmalaria.com).  Perhaps there are other contenders for the best option, whether they be [speculative causes](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/) or [causes soon getting robust measurement](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-would-it-take-to-prove-a-speculative-cause/), but none of them have been presented with a clear enough estimate yet to make this calculation work.  Whether or not you think this is a flaw in the speculative causes or a flaw in my reasoning about causes is [a discussion for elsewhere](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-im-skeptical-about-unproven-causes-and-you-should-be-too/).

[According to GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved), AMF saves a life for $2500, though this number has recently been [revised down to $2000](https://twitter.com/GiveWell/status/341706469256871937) because of the [newly reduced cost of bed nets](http://news.againstmalaria.com/post/2013/06/03/LLINs-are-now-close-to-US3-per-net.aspx).



But, of course, "save a life" doesn't make sense because everyone dies eventually.  As the joke goes, [life extension research](http://www.sens.org/) is the only charity actually working on _saving_ lives.  But [GiveWell clarifies](http://blog.givewell.org/2007/12/04/what-a-life-saved-means/):



> If you save someone right as they exit infancy (5 years old), you’ve saved someone who probably has around a 50% chance of making it to age 60 … another way of putting this is that if you save two lives (very very rough estimate of cost: $2000), you’ve in expectation given one person a full life that they wouldn’t have had. (You’re actually getting more than this, of course, since a person has a 75% chance of making it to age 30, but let’s keep it simple.)



So, on this model, $2000 "buys" an additional thirty [years of healthy life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year) that would not have otherwise existed.  Simplifying, that's $66 to save a year of healthy life.



Now let's go back to the assumptions.

For the same $66 you spend to save a year of healthy life via bednets, you could avert 942 years of nonhuman animal suffering on a factory farm given the assumptions we listed above.

This seems to give us a lot of room for pessimism.  What if we assumed the response rate were not 2%, but instead one tenth that -- 0.2%?  We'd still be averting a year of factory farming for 69 cents.  What conversion rate would it take to get to AMF's $66 mark?  **0.002%**, or **one person who becomes a vegetarian for every fifty thousand people who receive a pamphlet.**

Of course, even if you're on board with nonhuman animal suffering as something that matters, you might not think it's appropriate to weigh a year of chicken suffering averted as equal to a year of healthy human life gained.  It's a tricky philosophical question after all.  But even if you thought it took 100 chickens to outweigh a human, veg ads would still be worth it even if they only convinced **one in every five hundred people**.



Indeed, we can be pessimistic on all counts.

...We could think it takes 10 chickens to outweigh a human.
...We could think the current studies are bad enough that they're off by a factor of 10.
...And we could think that people who convert only convert for one year on average rather than four years.

...And veg ads would still have **three fold** the cost-effectiveness of AMF.



Now don't get me wrong, I actually think it's possible that the current studies are off by a factor of 10 or more.  This is why I think it's better to study veg ads than to fund them directly.

But I don't want this to be a cause for large despair, because **veg advocacy doesn't have to be all that good to be worth it.**
