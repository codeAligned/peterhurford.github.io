Well, today's the day for me to whisk off from my lovely home city of Cincinnati, Ohio to the shiny new city of Oxford, England.  Tomorrow, I officially start as a full-time intern for the organization [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org) for the next six weeks.

I can't say I'm excited _to go_ there, but I certainly am excited to eventually _be there_.  (The going, i.e. the transatlantic flight, doesn't interest me very much.)

See you across the pond soon.  And if any people there want to meet up, let me know!
