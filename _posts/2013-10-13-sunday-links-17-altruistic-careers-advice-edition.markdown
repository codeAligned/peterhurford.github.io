Should you "earn to give" or do direct work? [Here's one perspective.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hjn/earning_to_give_vs_altruistic_career_choice/)  Notably, the best people in direct work probably can accomplish a lot of good -- [the best 10% can do about 8x as well as the bottom 10%](http://80000hours.org/blog/69-how-good-are-the-best).

Wondering whether you'd be the type of person suited for direct work?  See [Holden Karnofsky talk about who would fit well at GiveWell](http://80000hours.org/blog/173-looking-for-a-seriously-high-impact-job-using-your-analytical-skills), [Ben Todd talk about who would fit well at 80,000 Hours](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/ia0/should_you_work_at_80000_hours/), or [Luke talk about who should work for MIRI](http://80000hours.org/blog/17-high-impact-interview-1-existential-risk-research-at-siai).

If you think computer programming is the way to go and are only missing the "how to make it happen" step, here's ["Advice on Getting a Software Job"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/di2/advice_on_getting_a_software_job/), ["Maximizing Your Donations via a Job"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hd1/maximizing_your_donations_via_a_job/), and [some more resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBkmLrQQiFaBCmB99FXObD4-8h2qVtJf-9EvanOuvvk/edit?usp=sharing).  It would be nice to see this for non-programming jobs.

Regardless of what job you try and land, though, [don't forget salary negotiation](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/).

Also don't forget to consider academics.  Here's [Nick Bostrom on how to make a difference as an academic](http://80000hours.org/blog/140-how-to-make-a-difference-in-research-an-interview-with-nick-bostrom).

Lastly, here's a bunch of people on LessWrong [giving career advice to a new college student](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ifo/what_should_a_college_student_do_to_maximize/).
