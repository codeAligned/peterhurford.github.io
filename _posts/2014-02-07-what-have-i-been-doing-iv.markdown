Periodically, in times of blog inactivity, I like to come back and report all the things I've been doing while not blogging.  Here's a complete run down of the more recent:

**I finished up Recruitment for my fraternity.**  It was basically working a part-time 20hrs/wk job for two weeks doing lots of event planning, but we ended up getting twelve fine men to join our fraternity.  Well worth it!

**I've been working with Ozzie Gooen on [.impact](http://www.dotimpact.im)**, a distributed volunteer force working to produce really useful projects.  Here's [a list of projects our group is working on](https://impact.hackpad.com/Projects-aRiPtncmuKS) and you can check [our meetings log](http://dotimpact.im/meetings.html) for their status.  Besides helping coordinate the group as a whole, I'm also working on building a [Job Board](http://www.jobboard.im) ([more details here](https://impact.hackpad.com/Job-Board-G2ZocnkVTsc)) and [studying vegetarian advocacy](https://docs.google.com/a/peterhurford.com/document/d/1nA3VYi3-UbAOefSWCNcFQQ2fTIceiX1CkyZMIHO-q2Q/edit).

**I've been working on learning more computer programming.**  In addition to working on the Job Board, I've begun to work for a friend's startup called [Jorge's Trading Post](http://www.jorgestradingpost.com), doing some PHP development for them.  I've also been learning more Ruby on Rails, Python, and JavaScript.  It helps that I'm now in a Computer Science class and have to program for actual homework.<!-- more -->

**I have been blogging, some.**  I've posted around here, but I've also been posting non-utilitarian stuff (gasp!) on [my Tumblr](http://peterhurford.tumblr.com).

**I'm still doing Senior Research.**  I'm researching political optimism and the influence of optimism on political behavior.  We just launched our survey recently on [Amazon's Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome).

**I'm still [debating Alonzo Fyfe](http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1024).**  The topic is whether Alonzo Fyfeâ€™s desirism or my two-level utilitarianism is the better theory of utilitarianism.

**I'm still involved in the [Denison Community Association](http://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/service-opportunities/dca)**, the umbrella organization for all volunteer service and service learning on Denison's campus.  I'm currently working to figure out how to get more people involved in service.

**I'm still involved in [Denison Venture Philanthropy](https://orgsync.com/custom_pages/10460/show/8585)**, a grant-making organization that gives out $10K and 200 volunteer hours to one non-profit each year.  This year, we're working with the [South Newark Civic Association](https://www.facebook.com/southnewark) to (1) get them a professional website, (2) do a survey-based needs analysis of the community, and (3) put together a booklet of local businesses.  I'm helping work on the website -- not programming, but helping them figure out how to talk to vendors.

**I'm still volunteering with [Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org).**  Recently, [I helped put together](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/ace-highlight-organization-evaluation-criteria/) some detailed [organization evaluation criteria](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/organization-evaluation-template/) that ACE will use to evaluate organizations going forward.

**I'm going to be giving a 12-minute [TEDx talk](https://www.ted.com/tedx)** on [effective giving](http://www.givewell.org/giving101) at [TEDxDenisonU](http://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/whats-happening/tedxdenisonu) on the 1st of March.
