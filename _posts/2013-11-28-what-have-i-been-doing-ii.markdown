You may (hopefully) have noticed that this blog has died out again.  Maybe you've even come to miss it.  After all, in past years, I've spent November doing [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org) for my blog (see [2011](http://www.greatplay.net/essays/the-nanowrimo-reflection) and [2012](http://www.greatplay.net/essays/the-nanowrimo-2012-reflection)), but this year I've done nothing blog-wise.

So what have I been doing, behind the scenes, while not blogging?  I'll tell you!<!-- more -->

**I've been working on applying to jobs.**  I'm no longer considering law school or graduate school at the moment and focusing instead on applying to good ol' fashioned jobs.  ...in market research and web development.  So far I'm 0 offers for 1 sent application.

**I've been spending a significant amount of time learning programming**, going through textbooks and [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com) to learn jQuery and Ruby on Rails.  I also signed-up for [an online class to learn R](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-002/class/index), the statistics package.  I hope to sharpen these skills to get those aforementioned jobs I just talked about.

**I've been working on the EA Projects Group** with [Ozzie Gooen](http://ozziegooen.com/).  This is [a group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/203204829847175/) dedicated to coordinating the work of online volunteers toward completing programming and research projects to further the effective altruist movement.  I'm working on a few of the programming apps myself while providing project management for the team.  We're currently working on branding ourselves and hope to have a new name soon.

**I've been volunteering for some effective altruist orgs**, like [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org), [Effective Animal Activism](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org) (soon to be renamed "Animal Charity Evaluators"), and [Effective Fundraising](http://www.effectivefundrasing.net).  I'm also working on a few things for [80000 Hours](http://www.80000hours.org).

**I started [a debate](http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1024) with Alonzo Fyfe of [Desirism](http://desirism.wikia.com/wiki/Desirism) and [Atheist Ethicist](http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/) fame.**  The topic is whether Alonzo Fyfe's desirism or [my two-level utilitarianism](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-does-utilitarianism-look-like-in-practice/) is the better theory of utilitarianism.

**I competed in the [Moot Court](http://www.acmamootcourt.org) Saginaw Valley Regional.**  My partner and I placed eighth which was respectable, but not quite as good as I had wanted and not good enough to qualify for Nationals like we did last year.  My eight years of law-related education are now officially over.

**I competed in my first official race** -- the [Cincinnati Thanksgiving Day 10K](http://www.thanksgivingdayrace.com/).  I've never run 10K before, so I was happy enough to do the entire thing without stopping, completing the 6.2 miles in 65 minutes and 59 seconds.  I placed 7409th out of some 17,000 people and I was outraced by a seven year-old kid.

**I've been working on quite a few other things**, like my senior research, being the Recruitment Chair of [my fraternity](http://denisonbeta.com/), being a stats tutor, and being a part of [Denison Venture Philanthropy](https://orgsync.com/custom_pages/10460/show/8585) and [Denison Community Association](http://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/service-opportunities/dca).

**I've been hanging out with friends and family.**  I also went and visited my girlfriend for a few days.  It is Thanksgiving, after all.
