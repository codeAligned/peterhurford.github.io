An idea I had while talking to Xio Kikauka and Joey Savoie is to run a jobs board for people interested in [effective altruism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism).  It seems like it actually would be relatively easy to have [a script](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) automatically monitor various job pages and synthesize them all into one area that looks nice.

Would this be useful to create? And if so, where should we get jobs from?

Some potential ideas:





  * The Humane League ([Jobs](http://www.thehumaneleague.com/jobs.htm), [Internships](http://www.thehumaneleague.com/internships.htm))


  * [Effective Animal Activism](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/about/get-involved)


  * [Giving What We Can](http://givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/work-with-us)


  * [80,000 Hours](http://www.80000hours.org/recruitment)


  * [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/about/jobs)


  * Innovations for Poverty Action ([Jobs](https://www.poverty-action.org/getinvolved/jobs), [Internships](https://www.poverty-action.org/getinvolved/internships))


  * [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](http://careers.gatesfoundation.org/search/?q=&location)



**[Added 19 Aug:**




  * Oxfam ([International Secretariat](https://www.oxfam.org/en/jobs/secretariat), [Affiliates](http://www.oxfam.org/en/jobs/affiliates))


  * [Nyaya Health](http://www.nyayahealth.org/join-us/)


  * The Hunger Project ([Jobs](http://www.thp.org/get_involved/work_with_us/employment_opportunities), [Internships](http://www.thp.org/get_involved/work_with_us/internship_opportunities))


  * [Population Services International](https://2xrecruit.kenexa.com/kr/cc/jsp/public/landingPage.jsf)


  * [Good Ventures](http://www.goodventures.org/about-us/jobs)


  * Farm Sanctuary ([Jobs](http://www.farmsanctuary.org/get-involved/jobs-intern-volunteer/jobs/current-job-listings/), [Internships](http://www.farmsanctuary.org/get-involved/jobs-intern-volunteer/internships/))

I'd be willing to make this happen if people were interested.

**Update 30 Jan 2014:** I'm now maintaining the list of jobs over at the [.impact Project page](https://impact.hackpad.com/Job-Board-G2ZocnkVTsc) instead.
