<b>Follow up to: <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/the-true-fear-of-being-wrong">The True Fear of Being Wrong</a></b>

From <a href="">utilitarianism</a> to <a href="">large amounts of donations</a> to <a href="">vegetarianism</a> to <a href="">existential risk</a> to <a href="">concern for wild animal suffering</a>, I advocate for a lot of ideas that are considered "out there".  Some people might even consider these views "crazy".

I'm a bit concerned about having these "crazy" ideas and talking about them openly.  Sometimes, I don't talk about them in person out of these concerns, even when I think advocating for them would otherwise have high value.  But what am I afraid of?<!--more-->

<h2>Actually Being Crazy</h2>
I suppose the first reason is that having "crazy" ideas might mean that I actually <i>am</i> crazy.  After all, crazy people don't know they're crazy.

<h2>People Won't Accept My More Mainstream Ideas Because I'm Seen as Crazy</h2>

<h2>Loss of Social Status, Relationships, and Reputation</h2>
