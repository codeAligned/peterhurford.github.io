I've made a variety of New Years Resolutions this year to commit to exercise.  I decided that I want a more detailed log to keep track of my progress on these plans so I know where to resume for future exercises and look back on my progress.  I then decided, in the spirit of my [reading list](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-reading) and [TV list](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-watching), why not make this public too?

Currently, I'm working on (1) [Stronglifts 5x5 Beginner Strength Training Program](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) and (2) running once a week.

In the past, I've committed to [Convict Conditioning](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0938045768) with the [Reddit modifications](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1gbfx2/training_for_34_hours_a_day_6_days_a_week_as_ido/), the Mount Holyoke’s Athletic Training ["No Excuses Workout"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_D_IjuAUl8) [YouTube], a vaguer kind of [high intensity interval circuit training](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/?smid=fb-nytimes&WT.z_sma=HL_TS7_20130510), the [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) running plan, the [Hundred Pushups plan](http://www.hundredpushups.com), and the [Two Hundred Sit-ups plan](http://www.twohundredsitups.com), but for various reasons, I'm not doing those anymore.

Nothing in this list is meant to be that awe inspiring.  I recognize myself as below average at fitness, but I'm getting much better.<!-- more -->
