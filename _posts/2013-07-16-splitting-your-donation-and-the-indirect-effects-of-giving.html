Let's say you're willing to donate money.  And perhaps further, you're willing to <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/the-pledge">give a good portion of money</a> and <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/">give effectively</a>, aiming it at <a href="http://80000hours.org/causes">some</a> <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities">particularly</a> <a href="http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">effective</a> <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/">organizations</a>.  But should you give your donation to one organization, or should you aim to spread it around?

The common wisdom is that you should spread it around, giving to whichever organizations you like and want to show support for.  Generally, people who accept this common wisdom are unconcerned with effectiveness, and give mostly to help their local community.  In doing so, lot's of organizations get help.

The wisdom among those interested in effectiveness, however, is to only give to one organization.  Why?  Economist Steven Landsburg explains in <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/everyday_economics/1997/01/giving_your_all.html">"Giving Your All"</a> that when you identify the most effective organization, it's likely you won't donate enough for marginal returns to lower enough to make it not as effective as your runner up.  Donating to a second organization means donating to a less effective organization, and that would be bad.

However, I think there's a significantly less naïve argument for splitting donations, based on the <i>indirect impact</i> of a donation, in addition to it's <i>direct impact</i>.  Sure, any donation you make is directly funding hopefully worthwhile and effective activities.  <b>But it's also doing other things</b>, such as allowing the organization the ability to learn how to improve, giving us more information about giving opportunities, buying you further access to the organization, and changing incentives -- <b>and these indirect effects favor splitting at least some of your donation up to multiple organizations.</b><!--more-->

<h2>Room for More Funding</h2>
One consideration when donating is <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/scalability">room for more funding</a>, or whether your <i>additional</i> donation will cause <i>additional</i> effective activities to take place that wouldn't have happened without your donation.  The idea is that organizations can only process and put money into action so quickly that even the most effective organization could be in a position where it can't (yet) make use of additional money in an effective way.

Room for more funding is one example of an indirect effect that could make you want to split your donation -- if you donate <i>so much</i> to the organization that they run out of funding, your additional giving should be placed elsewhere.  However, GiveWell currently estimates that their #1 non-profit, <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, could <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Roomformorefunds">absorb up to $67 million</a> (upper bound), so unless you're a billionaire, you probably won't need to worry about this.

<h2>Giving to Learn</h2>
GiveWell mentions that one of <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/20/near-term-grantmaking/">the reasons they make grants</a> is to "give to learn", or use philanthropy in order to acquire more information and make future money more effective.  As GiveWell writes:

<blockquote>In some cases a grant can be viewed as an “experiment” – a way to test a theory that a particular project will have a particular result, or will more generally be a worthwhile investment. [...Though, i]n our experience, understanding the outcomes/results of a given philanthropic project is usually a major undertaking, and it’s easy to learn nothing from a grant if one does not commit to such an undertaking.  Therefore, we try to pick “learning grants” of this type carefully.</blockquote>

When a donation is used, not only does the direct impact take place, but the organization itself learns a little bit about how they operate and can improve.  (Though, note that often non-profits can <a href="">be disconnected from their actual impact</a>, and thus often could learn <i>nothing</i>.)  Furthermore, donors can be in a position to learn as well, by seeing if their donation produces the intended outcomes.
