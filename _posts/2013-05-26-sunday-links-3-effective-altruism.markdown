Welcome to the third edition of Sunday Links!  This time, I want to explore links on one particular concept: _effective altruism_, a concept near and dear to both my heart and utilitarianism.

Peter Singer summarizes effective altruism [in his recent TED Talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Diuv3XZQXyc).

What's the key idea?  Will Crouch [defines effective altruism](http://effective-altruism.com/node/4) as starting with a "how" (a desire to do as much good as possible) and moving to a "what" (whatever does the most good), instead of the typical model of altruism, which starts with a "what" (ending cancer) and moving to a "how" (whatever campaigns end cancer).  It's very closely related to the idea of [issue-agnostic philanthropy](http://www.tacticalphilanthropy.com/2010/10/the-rise-of-issue-agnostic-philanthropy/).

Perhaps the biggest take away is that philanthropy involves trade-offs, because donating in one place means we're not donating in another place.  However, because our money could have gone further elsewhere, [we end up hurting people unintentionally](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-you-give-is-literally-a-matter-of-life-and-death/).  My favorite case for understanding the need for effective altruism involves Scott Siskind's [summary of efficient charity](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/), which I referenced before.  To make the idea of opportunity costs in spending apparent, Scott Siskind also jokingly suggests [we adopt dead child currency](http://www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html).

One example of effective altruism is to [focus more on the developing world than on the developed world](http://www.givewell.org/want-to-change-peoples-lives-give-internationally).  This might seem unintuitive at first, but when I think about it [in terms of triage](http://80000hours.org/blog/49-on-triage) or Julia Wise's [notion of worst subjects](http://www.givinggladly.com/2012/02/our-worst-subjects.html), it makes sense to me.  Jeff Kaufman's [debate with a pro-local friend of his](http://www.jefftk.com/news/2011-10-15) also helps.

But wouldn't this be really hard?  Well, the secret is that [we're rich](http://givingwhatwecan.org/why-give/how-rich-am-i), compared to the developing world.  But even so, [it doesn't have to be hard](http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/03/it-doesnt-have-to-be-hard.html).  You could just start _somewhere_, for some amount.

Where should you start?  I recommend a few places, like [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org), [The Life You Can Save](http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com), [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org). [80000 Hours](http://80000hours.org), and [Effective Animal Activism](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/).

There's much more that needs to be said, but this should be enough to get you going.  A whole world of helping more by "working smarter, not harder" awaits.
