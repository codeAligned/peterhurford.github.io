You may (hopefully) have noticed that this blog has died out again.  Maybe you've even come to miss it.  After all, in past years, I've spent November doing <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> for my blog (see <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/the-nanowrimo-reflection">2011</a> and <a href="http://www.greatplay.net/essays/the-nanowrimo-2012-reflection">2012</a>), but this year I've done nothing blog-wise.

So what have I been doing, behind the scenes, while not blogging?  I'll tell you!<!--more-->

<b>I've been working on applying to jobs.</b>  I'm no longer considering law school or graduate school at the moment and focusing instead on applying to good ol' fashioned jobs.  ...in market research and web development.  So far I'm 0 offers for 1 sent application.

<b>I've been spending a significant amount of time learning programming</a></b>, going through textbooks and <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a> to learn jQuery and Ruby on Rails.  I also signed-up for <a href="https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-002/class/index">an online class to learn R</a>, the statistics package.  I hope to sharpen these skills to get those aforementioned jobs I just talked about.

<b>I've been working on the EA Projects Group</b> with <a href="http://ozziegooen.com/">Ozzie Gooen</a>.  This is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/203204829847175/">a group</a> dedicated to coordinating the work of online volunteers toward completing programming and research projects to further the effective altruist movement.  I'm working on a few of the programming apps myself while providing project management for the team.  We're currently working on branding ourselves and hope to have a new name soon.

<b>I've been volunteering for some effective altruist orgs</b>, like <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>, <a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org">Effective Animal Activism</a> (soon to be renamed "Animal Charity Evaluators"), and <a href="http://www.effectivefundrasing.net">Effective Fundraising</a>.  I'm also working on a few things for <a href="http://www.80000hours.org">80000 Hours</a>.

<b>I started <a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1024">a debate</a> with Alonzo Fyfe of <a href="http://desirism.wikia.com/wiki/Desirism">Desirism</a> and <a href="http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/">Atheist Ethicist</a> fame.</b>  The topic is whether Alonzo Fyfe's desirism or <a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-does-utilitarianism-look-like-in-practice/">my two-level utilitarianism</a> is the better theory of utilitarianism.

<b>I competed in the <a href="http://www.acmamootcourt.org">Moot Court</a> Saginaw Valley Regional.</b>  My partner and I placed eighth which was respectable, but not quite as good as I had wanted and not good enough to qualify for Nationals like we did last year.  My eight years of law-related education are now officially over.

<b>I competed in my first official race</b> -- the <a href="http://www.thanksgivingdayrace.com/">Cincinnati Thanksgiving Day 10K</a>.  I've never run 10K before, so I was happy enough to do the entire thing without stopping, completing the 6.2 miles in 65 minutes and 59 seconds.  I placed 7409th out of some 17,000 people and I was outraced by a seven year-old kid.

<b>I've been working on quite a few other things</b>, like my senior research, being the Recruitment Chair of <a href="http://denisonbeta.com/">my fraternity</a>, being a stats tutor, and being a part of <a href="https://orgsync.com/custom_pages/10460/show/8585">Denison Venture Philanthropy</a> and <a href="http://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/service-opportunities/dca">Denison Community Association</a>.

<b>I've been hanging out with friends and family.</b>  I also went and visited my girlfriend for a few days.  It is Thanksgiving, after all.
