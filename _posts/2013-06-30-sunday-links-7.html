<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gu1/decision_theory_faq/">A Decision Theory FAQ!</a>  I'm almost certain these questions are not actually <i>frequently</i> asked, but if you ever wanted to know what decision theories were, here's a good way to find out.  (Note: decision theories are surprisingly not all that helpful at allowing you to make actual decisions in your everyday life.)

A study done over multiple time points showing with cool graphics <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2012/11/04/ideological-bias-and-the-jobs-report/">how conservatives react in a biased manner to political information</a>.  This isn't about conservative-bashing, though, as liberals exhibit the same phenomena under conservative presidents.  It just so happens that this study was done under a liberal president (Obama).

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)">Diplomacy</a> is a strange game where you have a map of World War I Europe and your goal is to capture up to 18 supply centers.  However, each player has the same sized army in the beginning and there are no luck elements.  All you can do is play off each other, forming and breaking alliances.  No one wants to play it because its a really long game (I've heard games can take days to finish), but I want to play it because it sounds like <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/32u/diplomacy_as_a_game_theory_laboratory/">a really exciting way to test game theory</a>.

The correlation between someone being pro-choice on abortion and pro-gay rights <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/08/09/the-myth-of-the-social-issues-the-politics-of-abortion-and-the-politics-of-gay-rights-are-different/">is not as strong as one might think</a>.  Also, pro-life stances are more common among liberals than one might think.

Dictator games, or laboratory tests intended to measure altruism by seeing how much money a participant is willing to split with another person, <a href="http://www.epjournal.net/blog/2013/05/are-all-dictator-game-results-artifacts/">are probably useful only in very specific conditions</a>, because the laboratory is not real life.

<a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/267576.html">Going to space probably isn't worth it</a>, unless incentives for private business change.

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-iraq/2013/03/15/f7a62a40-8772-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394_story.html">Five myths about Iraq</a>.

A <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/09/29/weekend-edition-the-life-you-can-save/">good review of the considerations surrounding donating to the third world</a>.

A <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/fanart/superman.pdf">unification of Superman's powers</a> [PDF].  One can derive all of Superman's powers from the single power to manipulate inertia.

<a href="http://www.spaceandgames.com/?p=27">100% confidence is a lot less common in practice than you might think</a>.  An amusing anecdote contained within.

There's an important difference between believing in something and <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/">believing you believe something</a>.
