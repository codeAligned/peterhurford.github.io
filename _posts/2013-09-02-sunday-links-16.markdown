Once you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it's like stabbing your soldiers in the back.  If you abide within that pattern, policy debates will also appear one-sided to youâ€”the costs and drawbacks of your favored policy are enemy soldiers, to be attacked by any means necessary."

["Optimal Philanthropy for Human Beings"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/6py/optimal_philanthropy_for_human_beings/): "The psychology of charitable giving offers three pieces of advice to those who want to give charity and those who want to receive it: Enjoy the happiness that giving brings, commit future income, and realize that requesting time increases the odds of getting money."
