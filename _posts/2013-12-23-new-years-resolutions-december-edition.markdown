_Follow up to ["New Years Resolutions: November Edition"](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions-november-edition/)._

Last January, I [outlined some New Years Resolutions](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions), and then did what I thought impossible -- used the power of blogging, precommitment, and betting to _actually stick to my plans_.  Following up [my last report in November](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/new-years-resolutions-november-edition/), I present my December update, which tracks how well I did in... November.  Sorry that's a bit confusing and that this was posted so late.

But anyways...<!-- more -->






## How Did November Go?


**Points:**  My goal was to score 13440 “daypoints” over the month according to my scoring system where different habits of mine are assigned different point values for each day.  I did not score the time period between the 22nd and 27th of November as I was on vacation.   Overall, I earned 13090 points, which was 97.4% of my goal.

**Time on task:** This month I spent an average of 10.58 hours a day working (a 74.06 hour work week), which is down from October's 74.9 hour work week and September's 81.5 hour work week, which means I'm continuing to lose a bit of steam.  (Note that work includes everything I do that's not sleep, reading, eating, exercising, showering, getting dressed, hanging out with friends/family, video games, spacing out, watching TV, and other commonsense things.)

**Time with friends/family:** I spent an average of 4.2 hours a day with friends/family, which is up from 3.3 hours a day in October.

**Exercise:** I spent an average of 58.3 minutes a day [doing exercise](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/logs/), mostly [Stronglifts](http://www.stronglifts.com/) and some running (down from 64.5 minutes a day in October).  I still improved my lifts (boosted my Squat from 155lbs to 190lbs, Bench from 80lbs to 85lbs, but did not improve my Deadlift) and my running distance (from 5.2mi to 6.2mi).

**Other Goals:** I met my goals for sleeping 75% of the time, breakfast 90% of the time, lunch 90%, dinner 50%, not snacking 45%, cleanliness 93%, and order 88%.






## What is New for December?


I think this is going decently well, so I want to try this again for the third time over December and then make updates as warranted for my next year of New Years Resolutions.  I aim to collect 17205 points.
