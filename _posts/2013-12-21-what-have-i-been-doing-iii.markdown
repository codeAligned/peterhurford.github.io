So, the blog went dead again, which means it's time to revive the blog with a run-down of all the non-blog things I've been doing recently.

**I finished my seventh semester of college,** which means I only have one more semester to go.  I'm now on Winter Break, which means I get a free month to do whatever I want.  This (probably) means more blogging!

**I've done a lot [more of the same](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-have-i-been-doing-ii/)** -- more career work (I have exciting news on this front forthcoming!), more EA projects work (we're called [.impact](http://www.dotimpact.im) now), more volunteering (though I've now stopped working with Giving What We Can in order to focus more on other projects), and more learning programming (this week is the last week of the R course!).

Actually, that's pretty much it.
