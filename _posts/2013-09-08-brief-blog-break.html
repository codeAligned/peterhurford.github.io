My time that I have available to blog has seen a noted decrease since I started college again and, honestly, my interest in blogging has waned a little bit.  So I think it's best that I take a one week blog break and focus on my other tasks.

<b>I should be back to posting here on</b> <s>16 September</s> <b>18 September.</b>  Talk to you then.
