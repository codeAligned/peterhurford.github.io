This is an interesting idea to increase the trustworthiness of self-reporting on survey results -- [let the respondent roll a die](http://io9.com/5826021/how-to-use-dice-to-prevent-people-from-lying-on-surveys/) and mandate that they lie if they roll a "6".  This way people can tell the truth and then claim they rolled a "6" if their response was ever called into question.

[Was Jane Austen good at game theory?](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/books/michael-chwe-author-sees-jane-austen-as-game-theorist.html?_r=0)

An interesting move toward more productivity: [hiring someone from Craigslist to slap you in the face when you are off task](http://hackthesystem.com/blog/why-i-hired-a-girl-on-craigslist-to-slap-me-in-the-face-and-why-it-quadrupled-my-productivity/).
