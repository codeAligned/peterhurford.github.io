_Follow up to ["How is Peter Exercising? 2013"](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-is-peter-exercising)._

I've made a variety of New Years Resolutions this year to commit to exercise.  I decided that I want a more detailed log to keep track of my progress on these plans so I know where to resume for future exercises and look back on my progress.  I then decided, in the spirit of my [reading list](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-reading) and [TV list](http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-is-peter-watching), why not make this public too?

Currently, I'm working on (1) [Stronglifts 5x5 Beginner Strength Training Program](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) and (2) running once a week.  Whenever I don't have access to a gym with free weights, I'll try to substitute with exercise machines or the [r/bodyweightfitness routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_beginner_routine) when possible.

Nothing in this list is meant to be that awe inspiring.  I recognize myself as below average at fitness, but I'm getting much better.<!-- more -->
