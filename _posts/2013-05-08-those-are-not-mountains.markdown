One hundred twenty-six days ago, I was overweight.  I was 6'1" and 220lbs. I needed to do something, so I turned to was exercise.  I started out trying to run.  I could barely run half a mile before I got winded and had to stop.  I couldn't keep going.  Now, 126 days later, I have run my first 5k.  I didn't do an official 5k or anything.  I just ran the 5k distance (3.1 miles) -- run away from my house, go 1.55 miles down the street, turn around, and run 1.55 miles back.

I had never run a 5k before.  I had once been very close.  I got all the way to 2.7 miles.  But then I got injured for a week, sick for another week, and didn't run for almost all of March.  I tried running again after that, but I got tired after running just a mile, and I stopped.  Eventually, after a bit more practice I worked my way back to being able to run 1.5 miles, but it still wasn't going well.  I was a long way away from being able to break the 5k barrier.<!-- more -->



Today, I wanted to run again.  I set out, thinking I could at least beat my previous 1.5 mile plateau.  This was the day I could run 1.6 miles.  It ended up being the day I ran my first 5k.  I not only broke through my plateau, but doubled the distance, broke through, and did what I never thought was possible.

I'm amazed at how much of the effort was mental.  The road I was on was very hilly, and I was weighed down by the knowledge that I hadn't been running so well recently.  Eventually, I saw one of the hills in the distance, and it looked steep.  I knew that I would never be able to run up them.  But I told myself that this was the time I had to do it, and I was determined to just not stop.  So I ended up running up the hill.  It turned out to not be steep at all.  The steepness that I had perceived earlier was just an optical illusion produced by the distance.



Eventually, the next hill came up.  It looked steep.  But I ran up it all the same, barely even noticing how steep it was once I actually came to it.  I grew amazed by how much of this was in my head; how much I was dramatizing it and making it worse with my negative thoughts.  Eventually, running a bit further, I got a pain in my chest.  I thought I should stop, just in case it was a problem.  This time, however, I decided to keep going, and barely two minutes later, the chest pain went away without any issue.

A bit longer in, my shoulder started hurting.  I wanted to stop.  I didn't.  Two minutes later, the shoulder pain was gone.

Later in, I started having a bit of trouble breathing.  I wanted to stop.  I didn't.  Eventually, I stabilized my breath, and kept on running just fine.



I think a lot of challenges in my life only look like challenges from the beginning, and I dramatized them with negative thoughts.  Now, I don't think that getting rid of negative thoughts is the secret of all of success.  I don't think that we shouldn't pay attention to challenges.  And I definitely don't think it's a good idea to keep running if you're experiencing pain and it isn't going away.

But many times in my life, I've noticed that I, as the idiom goes, "make a mountain out of a molehill".  But when I get to the hill and think it's too much of a mountain to surpass, I'm amazed at how easy it ends up being if I just pay no attention and keep on going.  Many of the mountains I encounter aren't mountains at all.  And I'm more successful when I remember that, and just keep on running.

It will be easier than I thought, because those are not mountains.
