<b>Giving to Africa accomplishes nothing.  All the aid is squandered by corrupt bureaucrats.</b>

<b>But giving still accomplishes litte, because the organizations squander it on overhead.</b>
imagine an org with no overhead - no electricity, volunteer flashlights, etc.

<b>If I really want to help someone, I'm better off giving the money directly to a homeless person.</b>

<b>But look how much we spend on foreign aid!  Surely if it were effective, problems would have been solved by now.</b>
1.) Aid isn't that much + wrong guesses about aid
2.) Problems have been solved

<b>I don't know much about the problems in Africa.  I don't want to be a "white in shining armor".  But I do know about the problems in my home town, so I'm going to help here.  Charity starts at home, right?</b>

<b>But morality isn't about giving to the third world.  It's about being a good person and upholding virtue.</b>

<b>I like my own local community better.  I want to give back.  Why shouldn't I just donate locally?</b>

<b>You can't save a life.  If I give a person an anti-malaria bednet, they'll just die of another disease in a few months, right?</b>

<b>But really, you can't save a life.  Everyone will die eventually.  So what's the point?</b>

<b>Okay, so maybe I'd be happy to "extend lives" or "save lives" or whatever you want to call it.  But all that will do is cause overpopulation, and that will lead to a whole host of other problems.</b>

<b>Shouldn't we be attacking "root causes" and not mere symptoms?</b>

<b>Giving to the third world is fine, but if we're taking this long-term view, aren't there even better opportunities?</b>

<b>Aid will just breed dependency.</b>

<b>I have a right to keep my own money.  I worked hard for it.  Why should I give it to other people who haven't worked hard for it?</b>

<b>The problem is too large.  I can't dent it.</b>

<b>Ok, so maybe I'm making some sort of dent.  But how can I know?  The problem is so large, I can't see my impact.  How do we know we're doing good?</b>

<b>We don't need aid.  We need political reform.  It's the system that's bringing us down.  In fact, philanthropy makes it harder to bring about this reform.</b>

<b>Giving personally is a needlessly conservative idea that ignores the benefits of public coordination and reform.</b> 

<b>I don't earn enough money to afford to give to charity.</b>

<b>If everyone gave all their money, the economy would collapse.</b>
