Someone asked me what the top ten posts are on Everyday Utilitarian.  I use Google Analytics, so this was a pretty easy thing to find out.  I looked at page visits for each essay over all of 2013.  Of course, this isn't a perfect metric, as essays written later in the year have less of a chance of getting viewed, and the "hits" metric is skewed a lot toward what I choose to publicize via Facebook and LessWrong and what I don't.

So this isn't much of a "top ten" by quality, I suppose.  But here it goes, anyway:
