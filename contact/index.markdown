You can contact me a variety of ways, and I love correspondence with those who use this site.  The most efficient and reliable method would be to send an email to [peter@peterhurford.com](mailto:peter@peterhurford.com).

However, you can also reach out to [my Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/peterhurford) ([@peterhurford](http://www.twitter.com/peterhurford)) or my [Reddit account](http://www.reddit.com/user/peterhurford/).  If you know me more personally, you could also reach out to me via Facebook, Skype, text message, phone call, or in person.
